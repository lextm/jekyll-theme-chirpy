We dropped Visual Studio 2005 support a few weeks here in #SNMP. However, we will continue to target .NET 2.0 users till .NET 2 mainstream support expires.

Simply speaking, this means #SNMP Library (SharpSnmpLib.*.dll) can still be used for .NET 2.0 applications (but you must be running .NET 2.0 SP2). We no longer support .NET 2.0 without SP, or .NET 2.0 SP1 before April 12, 2011. After that day, I will start to target .NET 3.5 SP1 and .NET 4.0 only.

Retiring .NET 2.0 helps bring features such as extension methods and so on to (SharpSnmpLib.*.dll).
