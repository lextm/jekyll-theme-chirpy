(CSDN June 08, 2006)

Finally some bugs are fixed, and some OTA bugs are worked around. There are some grooves that are too wide to cross. And as a result, some features in list are disabled now.
<!--more-->

Main changes:

1. \* Plus Manager GUI is updated. Use TreeView instead of ListView.
1. \* AutoCompletion is tuned again.
1. \+ Adds some XML tag supports in C# that you can invoke in Ctrl + J. (BDS 4 only)
1. \* #13 bug on the bug tracker is fixed.
1. \- Input Helper is disabled.
1. \* AddMany Plus now works well under BDS 1.0.
1. \- FileWizards of WiseEditor Plus is disabled under BDS 1.0.
1. \* Documents are updated.

Also it is NixNewNer Final, not a RC any more.
