What happened tonight is that I turned off User Access Control on Vista. CTeX and MiKTeX had been removed while MiCTeX was installed instead which generates PDF documents correctly now.

So now CHM and PDF files are back.

After the half-cooked Preview, I would provide a Milestone 1.

* Documents will be included.
* UAC traps will be overcome.
* Vista dialogs are supported. Refer to [this article](http://www.codeproject.com/vista/VistaControls.asp) for details.

Stay tuned.
