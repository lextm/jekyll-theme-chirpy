Marco Cantuâ€™ has done an interesting post about online communities. It seems that as a C# developer I should join some professional network like LinkedIn. So now I add a button on this blog which links to my LinkedIn profile.

The profile is similar to my resume where I put all required information there. This is completely different from my Facebook profile which mainly focuses on my education.
