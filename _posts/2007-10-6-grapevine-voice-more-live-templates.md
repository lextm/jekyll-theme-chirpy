TypingSpeeder feature in Code Beautifier Collection originates from Sharp Builder Tools' AutoComplete feature. David tried to create something similar to Live Templates feature now available in Delphi 2007 (first introduced in BDS 2006). In fact CodeRush and Castalia provides similar feature too.

Have to say that Live Templates is much more powerful because it supports editable stops in code. So I will move some functions out of TypingSpeeder and re-implement them using Live Templates.

Stay tuned.
