I have been using 7-Zip for years. In this way I can save a little money. But after saying goodbye to WinZip or WinRAR, I miss the beautiful manager GUI of archives. The 7-Zip default manager looks simple and ugly which should be considered as a prototype.

And today, when I browsed to 7-zip.org, I found a link on the front page which leads to [here](http://www.jzip.com/). And have to confess that jZip is wonderful! Both the program icon and the manager GUI is perfect. Thus, I can give up default 7-Zip now.

Hope to see a Linux version of jZip soon.
