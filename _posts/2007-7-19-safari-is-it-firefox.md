When I tried to find a Google Toolbar for Safari, I was redirected to a Firefox only page at http://tools.google.com/firefox/toolbar/FT3/intl/zh-CN/index.html

Does Google think that Safari is Firefox or in fact it is?

BTW, to open a new tab in Safari, you can press Ctrl + T, which is the same as in Firefox.
