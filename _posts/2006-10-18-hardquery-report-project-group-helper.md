You can not see this helper until you are working on a large project group. Yes, just like what I do every day with CBC. Compared with SharpDevelop, BDS is not smart enough to activate a project when you are working on one of its files. As a result, you have to activate it yourself which is much boring.

How to ease your experience? SBT adds a menu to activate the project for you. But you still need to click a menu item or use a shortcut. I make things easier. When you switch among the files inside Editor, corresponding projects are activated for you automatically.

Isn't it useful? Hey hey, I like it this way.

This feature was first introduced in latest R2M5. Try it.
