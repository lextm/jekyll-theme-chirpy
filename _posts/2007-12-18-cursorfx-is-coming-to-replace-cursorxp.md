If you want a nice cursor on your screen, you may give CursorXP a try. But today, Stardock publishes a preview of CursorFX which surely is better than CursorXP.

Something interesting is that Stardock starts to use InstallAware to package setups. Yes, WISE is no longer optimal in this land today.

BTW, CodeGear is going to tune its install package for RAD Studio. I doubt how much InstallAware can contribute because it is the MSI engine inside Windows and the Windows itself that cause so many problems. The only hope is the upcoming MSI engine 4.5. It seems that this last hope is not yet part of Vista SP1 (or XP SP3), so Microsoft must be working hard on it.
