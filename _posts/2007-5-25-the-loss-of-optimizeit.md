When Borland acquired OptimizeIt, we saw the new products bundled in JBuilder and Delphi. I never touch the Java piece but it seems to be wonderful. The only piece I tested was Optimizeit Profiler for .NET which was not quite powerful and useful.

After that I tried TestComplete and AQTime. I have to say that AQTime is really nice. It is much better than the profiler.

Maybe Borland saw this, it acquired Silk then. I will try SilkPerformer soon to see if it is easy to use.

I was informed that my company will employed more software guys, which means we will in bad need of such tools.

Wish I could touch some wonderful piece later this year.
