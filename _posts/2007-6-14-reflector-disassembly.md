.NET Reflector is such a powerful tool to live with. But I found it bias to C#.

I have disassembled a VB.NET dll lately and cannot compile the generated project at all. However, with a C# compiled dll, anything works fine.

I do not have time to see what is the matter, but maybe I can say writing in VB.NET is more secure than C# in certain cases.
