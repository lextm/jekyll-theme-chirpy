Because of You-Will-Soon-Know-It, I am planning to release a new Milestone of GrapeVine. Main changes are in the installer. It should be able to tell if you installed necessary Update of Delphi/C++Builder. The side effect is also clear that you have to install latest Updates. If not, the installer is going to exit. I believe some users may complain about this. However, it is a must from now on. Because CBC is an IDE plug in, it cannot live healthy without latest Delphi IDE.

Now I start to do some final tests. Wish everything okay. Stay tuned on both this blog and CodeGear homepage.
