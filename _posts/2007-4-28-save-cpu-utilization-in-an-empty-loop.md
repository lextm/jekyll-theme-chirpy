Sometimes you need to kill some time by running an empty ‘’for’’ or ‘’while’’ loop. The only problem is that the CPU utilization will soon reach 100% for a single core CPU or 50% for a duel-core. Oh, my Goodness, it is horrible.

How to solve the problem and protect your/and your users’ CPU? A simple walk around is there. Just write Thread.Sleep(??); inside the loop. In my case, I let it sleep for 500-ms. In this way, the utilization can be reduced to a quite small number.
