I love to use RAVE Report, but it does not support Windows Forms. So I switch to Crystal Reports for .NET. Have to say it is hard to find good materials to learn Crystal Reports until I found [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Reports-Programming-Brian-Bischof/dp/0974953652) in the morning.

I cannot buy this book easily because I am here in China. I earn a little and the book price is too high. I hope one of the local presses can print this book out but it surely takes time. So, I try to read the sample chapters and find that some answers to my questions are already there.

The book is well organized and written so reading it (even the sample chapters) is real fun. Hope one day I can get a copy at hand.

If you need to start developing Crystal Reports for .NET, have a look at this book.
