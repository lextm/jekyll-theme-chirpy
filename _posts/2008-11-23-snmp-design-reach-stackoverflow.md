I love StackOverflow a lot because it is a good place to share experience. But I did not realize it is also a good place to advertise #SNMP until I came across this link today (I found this link on CodePlex Stats page for #SNMP). I am so happy that #SNMP was recommended by my users. I must be doing something right, isn't it? :)

All right. You must have read my words now, so what is your opinion? Compared to those commercial package, #SNMP still lacks a few advanced features. But I believe you will think twice. For an open standard like SNMP, isn't it reasonable to try some implementation that is also open? Yeah, #SNMP is free and open source.
