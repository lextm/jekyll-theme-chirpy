Today a post in the Discussions section asked if #SNMP library can be used to send out TRAP message. You can read my reply here because I don’t want to copy myself. But this is really a question I don’t have the answer. So how many C# developers are doing SNMP agent development?

I have just created a poll at my blog. So if you are doing C# SNMP agent, vote it. If there are enough requirement, I am going to enhance #SNMP library in that field.

# Updated:

Now #SNMP 4 introduced an agent reference design, #SNMP Agent. We already did a lot of improvement in version 5 development phase, and now it is much more powerful and Mono/openSUSE compliant. Please check out [this post](/catpaw-rumors-we-are-truly-mono-ready-7c2a1d07835d)
