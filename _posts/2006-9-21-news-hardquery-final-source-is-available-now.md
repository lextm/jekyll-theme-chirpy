As an open source project, I should have published the source along with the installer. However, if that was the case, the installer would be much larger. As a result, since NixNewNer, they have been separated.

Because I have to modify NAnt script again to build a source package, this time the source package comes a little bit late. But now it is there.

Some big changes take place in this new version, so after reading some portions of code you will see the differences. I could not make a Developer's Guide in a few months as there is a lot to say in it, so whenever you want to make a plus of your own, the source code of other pluses surely helps.
