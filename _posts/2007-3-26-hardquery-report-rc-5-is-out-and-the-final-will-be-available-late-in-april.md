(CSDN March 26, 2007)

I am now packing for leaving for Shanghai and I will start my career there. As a result, I do not have plenty of time to make the 5.3.3 Final ready in weeks. I wish I could have time to ship it in April. In fact this latest RC 5 is stable enough for you to use.

Luckily I have fixed the Code DOM bugs which hides in the Source Navigator and Typing Speeder features. Give the latest RC a try and you will see something very useful for C# coding.

The RC 5 can be downloaded from here.

Stay tuned. I will blog again once I reach Shanghai.
