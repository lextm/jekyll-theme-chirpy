(CSDN Sept 06, 2006)

ArtCSB Plus is added. Other changes are minor.

Personally I love ArtCSB 2.5 a lot and am happy to bring it back.

Since NixNewNer Update 1 has a big bug, #25 on GForge bug tracker, I remove it from the download list. New users may use a milestone version or wait for the final.

I am doing a lot of testing recently and wish to release the final as soon as possible.

P.S. ArtCSB 2.5 is created by Artyom Fedyuk.
