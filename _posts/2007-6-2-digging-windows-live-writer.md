For a new Windows Live Writer, these three things you may not know (but you know now).

Do you know this tool is written in .NET? Open it in Reflector, you can even see the source code.

Do you try the latest beta version 1.0(12.0.1193.524)? It will consume your single CPU if you are not using a dual core CPU like me.

Do you know you can set up blog entry categories even in Blogger.com? Yes, Writer makes use of Tag to set up categories. So if you used Tag in the old way, you have to manually remove all the old tags and start to make it categories. Because I have few Tags, the transformation is not tough for me.
