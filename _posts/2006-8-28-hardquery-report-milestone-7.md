You can read Readme.pdf included to see all changes I made in this summer.

There are really a lot of changes so many old bugs are found and fixed.

Wish you enjoy this build although it is not quite stable. If you disable NFamily Plus, I guess it will be much more stable.

The Final version will release soon in Sept.

But I do not know whether the Final version could support the Turbos.

P.S., There is no more Preview term here. Instead, Milestone is used.
