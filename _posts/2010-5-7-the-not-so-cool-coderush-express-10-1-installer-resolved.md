I have been expecting CodeRush Express 10.1 for a few weeks, but when I touched it and tried to install, it disappointed me with such a page.

Yes, everything is ready but I cannot click the Install button. Why? No hint from the installer, or its installation log.

I have fired a bug report, and let's see what the guys will say, http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/B147309.aspx

Updated: DevExpress team has resolved this issue.
