Like I said in the previous post, Steve and I had a long discussion this morning and worked out a small list of items for CrossRoad. (Note that we don’t count bugs, as we want to fix them all as soon as possible always.)
<!--more-->

Now we have four items listed here in the Issue Tracker, open for CrossRoad,

1. 3709: Unity will be used in both Browser and Compiler. (done)
1. 2278: I will make the Compiler 1.0 ready. (done)
1. 3708: Steve will implement TRAP and INFORM support in the Browser.
1. 3408: I will integrate Browser and Compiler so we can add/remove/load/unload MIB modules easily.

I have to confess the Compiler 1.0 is a big task, as we have to add a lot of basic features to make it useful. But don’t worry, I already have a lot of ideas about it in mind. Now it is time to put them into this tool.

Well, Steve provides 3.0 a codename of Trident. This follows our tradition that every codenames implicitly contains the version number.

We are open to any comments. Please share your ideas with us here.
