When I installed Office 2007 Trial, I knew it is Office only because of its title bar — Office 2007. The look is much different from Office 2003/XP, and every menu items are gone.

The mans from Redmond call this UI Ribbon while someone names it rubbish. Even for me, a guy who is curious about new things, the UI is hard to learn and use. During my trial I finished my Master essay in Office 2007 with a lot of efforts.

Now if you face the challenge you are much luckier, because an Office add in can ease the pain -

Classic Menu for Office 2007

The screen shot is very attractive. However, my trial has expired so I can not try this one any more.
