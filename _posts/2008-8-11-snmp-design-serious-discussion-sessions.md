Sometimes, maintaining an open source project is just like running a one-man show. There could be a lot of users, but most source code came from you and you were the only player in the field. I felt so lonely in the past.

In fact, there were people who wanted to join me. However, they were either too busy or not well prepared. I was disappointed. Luckily, receiving suggestions and bug reports from users is also fun.

I guess Code Beautifier Collection and Alex will remain like this in the near future. Unexpectedly, the last project goes differently, because this time I finally pick up a general topic, SNMP.

I did know there is a lot of guys doing SNMP out there in almost all main stream languages and platform. But I never knew so many are doing it in C# and .NET. Thus, I was surprised at the download count. Can you imagine a just released new project such as #SNMP has a similar download count in the first month like a three year old project?

And the latest news inspires me more. The sessions on CodePlex now turn out to be serious. Guys start to post design suggestions, new feature requests, and even ask if I can focus on the library while they work on the browser. Wonderful.

I confess that I do not have enough experience on how to host an open source project with others, but I believe that I try my best to learn.

Stay tuned.
