Lately I did not update the browser, and of course users met issues with it and posted on the discussion board here. Thank you so much for posting your ideas. They helps me sharp the browser in design.

But before the 1.0 release scheduled this weekend, I think I have no time to update the browser. Thus in my last post, I proposed a 1.5 release to address the browser issues. As a result, when you see 1.0 some day, don't blame me for the browser quality.

I talked about the browser plan in details, so if you have any suggestions to add, please append your words there.

Stay tuned.
