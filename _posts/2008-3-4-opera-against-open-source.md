I have just read this interview of Opera CEO. And it is funny to see how he fights against Microsoft and, open source.

Yes, if Opera goes open source, there is no guarantee that it should last for long and the source code quality might become bad. However, doesn’t Firefox evolve in this way?

I never download Opera or Maxthon but I do have tried Safari for a few weeks (and give it up because of bad Chinese support). Now I start to resist new trials and bind myself to Firefox, an open source solution.

I love freedom, and that’s why I love open source. And that’s why Firefox becomes my choice. Let’s see what would happen to Opera in the long run. What I am sure is that Firefox can live as long as Opera.
