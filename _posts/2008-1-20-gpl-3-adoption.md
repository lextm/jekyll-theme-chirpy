Even though Linus denies to put Linux kernel under GPL 3, we continue to see other projects moving to GPL 3, a special upgrade of GPL 2 after Novell and Microsoft agreement. Two latest examples of such adoptions are EA’s SimCity and Trolltech’s Qt.

At last I remind you that Code Beautifier Collection is licensed under GPL 3 too.
