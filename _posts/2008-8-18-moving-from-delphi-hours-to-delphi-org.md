I have just discovered a new podcast named The Podcast at Delphi.org. It is quite funny that Nick Hodges will show up in the upcoming episode 2 as a guest.

I take it as a sign there are no more Delphi Hours episodes. Sad. But this time, I am happy that I can subscribe to the podcast easily in iTunes.

How to subscribe? Simply launch your iTunes, open iTunes Store, and search for "Delphi".
