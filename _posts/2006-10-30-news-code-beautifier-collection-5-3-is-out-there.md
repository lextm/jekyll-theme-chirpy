(CSDN Oct 30, 2006)

I have been busy these days hunting for a job. I am not lucky enough because I did not get any valuable certifications, such SCJD or MCSE. I should have spent time on them but I’ve devoted so much to Code Beautifier Collection. No regret yet, but I am sad still.

I will go on developing this tool until the day all users disappear. I will find a job soon, although it may not be what I want the most. I have to keep myself alive.

BTW, I have published this brand new version on BDN already, and it is also available here.
