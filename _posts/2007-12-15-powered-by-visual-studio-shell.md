Finally Microsoft releases something like Eclipse RCP and several projects soon pop up.

If you've subscribed to VSX Team Blog you may already know there is now a free and stand alone IronPython Studio out there with other interesting pieces.

Now what I am waiting for is a Chrome Studio from RemObjects. Because those guys know so much about how to extend Visual Studio, a Chrome Studio must be possible.

The only issue you might meet some day is that you cannot modify the shell because Microsoft does not provide the source code like Eclipse.
