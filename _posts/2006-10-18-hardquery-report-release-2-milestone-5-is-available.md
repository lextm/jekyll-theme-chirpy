Today is a special day. Yes, I am 24 years old from this moment on and I am glad to tell you Release 2 of HardQuery is on its way. It is a special version indeed, so when you programme with it, you will surely see fun. LeXDK 5.3 is even easier to extend but I have to update those documents again.

Before I finish, this Milestone 5 version will certainly give you all the new features.

Soon the Final version will be out.
