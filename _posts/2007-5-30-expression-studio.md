From a developer's view, Visual Studio is fully capable of WPF design because you can design the forms in it. However, if you used Expression Blend, you will agree with me â€” that is amazing. I never knew a form could be be designed like an art.

I have just installed Expression Blend May Preview and finished a demo project. The feeling was like using Photoshop or Expression Design.

Have to confess that Microsoft is now cloning Adobe. First with Expression, and now with Silverlight. Do we really need two variations of Photoshop and Flash?
