I have said in an old post that *.blogspot.com domain is blocked here in Shanghai. The only workaround is that I can log into *.blogger.com to publish posts. It is really inconvenient to copy content from WLW to Blogger.com. But WLW Beta 2 cannot log into my Blogger account because it is not designed for Blogger.

When I installed WLW Beta 3 at home this morning, Wow! It can log into my Blogger account now! Even though it still cannot receive the style I use, that is not a big problem.

Nice to see Windows Live Team do something this wonderful. Their support for Blogger.com as well as other blog spaces does make millions of bloggers happy.
