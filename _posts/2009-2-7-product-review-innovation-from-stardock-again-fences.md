You never know what the Stardock guys are planning for the next month. And this time Fences hits me a lot. I know that I cannot explain its coolness well, so suggest you pay a visit to this page. You will regret if you don't do that just now :)

However, I have problems downloading the installer from that page. So I simply launch Impulse and install Fences from within. It is lightening fast. Awesome.
