It is hard to find what I need now when I look into the log file generated. There are a lot of lines in that file that prevent me from finding the most important one.

As a result, I have to try something better than Debug and Trace. I have tried Microsoft's shared source Enterprise Library. However, it is not easy to use it in CBC, as the assemblies are loaded by BDS.exe. So I have to search again and find log4net suitable.

In 5.3.1.1003, log4net is used to make the log file. I have to say it is easy to learn and use, although the migration costs me a lot of time. I will finish this boring task these days and release an RC 3 soon.

Stay tuned.
