Well, there are already posts on the Internet about this issue, that snmpd.exe crashes on Windows. I am using Windows Vista SP2 and I also notice this issue.

In Windows Event Log (Application category) it is too easy to locate the crash information,

(On a Chinese Windows Vista SP2 machine)
``` text
错误应用程序 snmpd.exe，版本 0.0.0.0，时间戳 0x4abf748e，错误模块 unknown，版本 0.0.0.0，时间戳 0x00000000，异常代码 0xc0000005，错误偏移量 0x00000000， 进程 ID 0x1a14，应用程序启动时间 0x01cbc2a468461494。
```

0xc0000005 means access violation, but it cannot tell you what is the root cause.

I was planning to troubleshoot it further, but suddenly I found this paragraph on OpenSSL site, http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

About OpenSSL 1.0.0: Today (May 4, 2010), the 1.0.0 builds are released. Finally. Developers can begin testing against it. Users should still consider this beta — if your SSL-enabled software works for you under 1.0.0, then great, if not, downgrade to 0.9.8n. We are now in a transitionary phase to the 1.0.0 series. Developers: In order to keep things simpler, 0.9.8n will be removed in a few months — upgrade ASAP. For most software, upgrading won’t be an issue.

Therefore, I tried to uninstall OpenSSL 1.0.0c and install 0.9.8q instead.

Guess what? Yes, everything starts to work fine.

So if you plan to use Net-SNMP agent on Windows, remember that choosing a proper version of OpenSSL is what you should consider.

BTW, I have fired a bug report to OpenSSL guys, and hope they can find out a solution.
