A long time ago there was voices asking whether #SNMP can be used in PowerShell.

So why did I never focus on this area? Well, because I am a C# developer, and I am not a PowerShell master. Though I took some PowerShell training and the trainer was "the Script Queen" from local Microsoft office, I am still conservative toward PowerShell. I really hope that C# vNext can become a PowerShell alternative (as the Mono guys did http://www.mono-project.com/CsharpRepl).

OK. If you do want to use #SNMP in PowerShell, you can now follow these tips,

Sorry that I don't know who wrote it, but it is just excellent. Once you come over the poor generic support in PowerShell, you can find that #SNMP API is so easy to consume even in a script language.
