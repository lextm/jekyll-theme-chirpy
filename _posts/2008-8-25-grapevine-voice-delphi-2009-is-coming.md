Since GrapeVine is not as active as usual, I have to say there will be no new features coming in the next few months. But two things will go on soon.

The very first is a new release for Delphi 2007. This will be the August release (or September release). Even though four months passed, there are only a few small fixes added in the repository. (Sorry guys, I have spent so much time on #SNMP.) And the second one is a new release for Delphi 2009.

I really hope I can do one release for both IDE versions, but the possibility relies on CodeGear's implementation. Therefore, all new releases will be available only after CodeGear releases Delphi 2009 officially.

Yes, you may already know Delphi 2009 is "available" today, but it only means you can place an order from now on. The final release day is not yet published, so nobody knows when you can have it installed on your development machines (or virtual machines).

Stay tuned.
