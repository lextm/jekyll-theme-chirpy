After a month, it is time to publish a release of #SNMP to public. So you can now find the Halfbaked (0.5) release here.

I didn't notice I have already done most 0.9 release goals in this very first release, so from now on I can focus on MIB support for a few weeks.

Please notice that even though I placed an experimental MIB parser in it, the code is quite experimental so not suitable for critical applications. Also I can promise that the interfaces for MIB operations will change a lot after even one week (

in fact, a lot have changed today).

Stay tuned.
