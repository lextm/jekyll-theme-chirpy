In old posts I talked about the localization work I have done on my project. The posts reflects my understanding of .NET localization. However, if you really need to do localization on an important project, those posts cannot help.

But there are a lot of experts in this fields, such as Guy Smith-Ferrier, author of the book ".NET Internationalization". Even though I do not have a copy right now, I have read the two sample chapters freely available. Yes, it is a well written book about the localization process. Once the project in my charge needs more efforts on localization, I believe this book will help.

The only thing missing is ResEx. And I guess at that moment, this quite useful tool has not been built.
