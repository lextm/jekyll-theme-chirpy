Code Central is where most Delphi and C++Builder guys publish their creations. You can also find my items there.

I have to mention that if you do not update your item frequently, it will disappear soon from Recent Uploads list. That's why I keep updating CBC new versions there.

And what is interesting is that CodeGear starts to publish its old products and documents there in the latest months. As a result, I have to fight with CodeGear items for the first time. (Yes, it is fun.)

Look forward to more items from CodeGear at Code Central. Please add some fresh items, CG guys.
