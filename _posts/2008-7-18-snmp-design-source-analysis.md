I have been using Mattâ€™s StyleCop Addin for SharpDevelop for almost two weeks and it is wonderful. So from now on, I am going to enhance #SNMP source files to make the code look better.

Luckily #SNMP is not a too large project and I am just getting 10,000 warnings from StyleCop. Hope that I can clean most of them up this weekend and deliver you UnicornHorn by then.

Stay tuned.
