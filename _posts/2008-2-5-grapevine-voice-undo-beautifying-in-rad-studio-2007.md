Today another change in RAD Studio is found during my test on CodeBeautifiers Plus. It seems that redo/undo mechanism is updated. Therefore now if you want to undo after Ctrl + W, you must press Ctrl + Z twice.

Also I received final reply from Anthony this morning. After tests, the result is perfect. Even though it is right now a internal build, I decide to release it in 6.0. You may consider it as a customized build of JCF 2.34.

Stay tuned.
