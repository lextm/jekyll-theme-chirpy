CodeRush for Visual Studio is now 100% native .NET code. Yes, the same as Code Beautifier Collection for CodeGear RAD Studio. And what else do the two look alike. Both use plug-in architecture so easy to extend.

I have just installed Refactor! for evaluation and also taken a look at DXCore. Yes, I have to say I learn a lot from the User Guide and soon decide to update CBC heavily in 6.0 M6 to provide a more flexible architecture.

Maybe one day I can move CBC to Visual Studio with DXCore. Quite possible.

Why not in M5? M5 is due to release this week so you can play with it on Delphi/C++Builder 2007 Update 3 and RAD Studio 2007.
