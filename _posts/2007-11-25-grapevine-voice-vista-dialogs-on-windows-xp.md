At this moment, I know that it is possible to emulate those Vista only dialogs on Windows XP. JSDialog is perfect for Delphi but for .NET, there is no such a thing.

I have been using Vista_API library for a few months but it's command link support is not yet perfect for Windows Vista Home Basic (its ListView and TreeView support is great). Today I found [this article](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/Vista_TaskDialog_Wrapper.asp), and its implementation is OK on Windows Vista Home Basic.

I will add those dialogs to GrapeVine Final. Stay tuned.
