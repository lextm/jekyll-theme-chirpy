I am using Windows Live Mail 2011 to write blog post, as Writer cannot connect to Blogger here in China. But at first Spelling button was greyed out and I did not know why.

Well, the fix is not hard to find,

1. Click Mail start menu –> Options –> Mail.
1. Switch to Spelling tab
1. Make sure you have a default language chosen under Languages. For me, I choose English (UK).
