I started to work on Touch Mouse Mate early this year. The very first change set on GitHub was on Feb 25. I was able to pack the original work done by J5 as 1.4 release, and even added some of my own ideas in 1.5 Beta release.

However, I am not able to drive this project further any more, as I have been involved in too many open source projects, and I have to reset my focus to only a few of them. Therefore, like what I did in the past (for Code Beautifier Collection, M8 Theme Builder, and so on), I will stop working on TMM in the future (well, I have been idle on it for a few months already).

As the source code is released under MIT/X11, you can feel free to fork it and modify it to suit your own need. New projects have already started in this area, such as Touch Mouse Plus,

http://touchmouseplus.codeplex.com

Please start hacking if you are a developer, and start watching the new projects if you are an ordinary user. Microsoft does not yet demonstrate any further plan on Touch Mouse in Windows 8 (I am writing this post on Windows 8 Release Preview), so we are still on our own.

Good luck, guys.
