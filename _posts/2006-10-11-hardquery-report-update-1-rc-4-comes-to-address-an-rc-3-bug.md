It is RC 3 that adds more features while introducing a few annoying bugs. The worst one is that when you launch InDate from outside of BDS, the options are not loaded and an null reference exception occurs.

Now, RC 4 fixes this bug and others. I am wishing I could deliver you the final version of Update 1 soon.

Stay tuned.
