We just started to enjoy some of the benefits of switching to Mercurial,

* We won't cry out when the repository on CodePlex is corrupt, as my local one is still healthy. If you have cloned one copy, you can verify its health by running `hg verify` at a command prompt.
* The development is still active as I can use my local one to store new change sets.
* (Most important) We can easily find another place to host the repository so that all collaboration can be resumed.

Now we have Plan B for our repository. Before CodePlex fixes our repository there, we will use Google Code temporarily, http://code.google.com/p/sharpsnmplib/.

Please continue to visit our CodePlex home page, http://sharpsnmplib.codeplex.com for all other information (discussion board, issue tracker, and wiki).
