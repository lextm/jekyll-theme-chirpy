If you have time, please go and see this page on Microsoft.com, named Open Source at Microsoft.

I find it ironic because in fact even if an application running on Windows is claimed as Open Source, it is not that free. For example, it is not free of Windows. Windows is closed-source. If one day Windows is dead (and Microsoft starts another platform), that application may be dead.

For a truly open source project, its basis should be open source, too. That's why the KDE guys spent so many years with Trolltech on persuading it open Qt under GPL.

Also I find myself stupidly building CBC on Windows. Yes, CBC is not open source in some aspect according to the analysis above. But is there a CodeGear RAD Studio for Linux?
