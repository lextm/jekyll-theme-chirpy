I am using a Vista Home Basic machine. And when I try to launch a VMware image of OpenSuSE, the system freezes. Why?

After reading the Release Notes carefully, I see that VMware Server I installed does not yet claims itself Vista compliant. As a result, I turn to VMware Player and find it just right.

It seems VMware spends more time on Player which is also bundled with Workstation and ignores Server most of the time which is totally free.

Pity that I cannot create any image now on Vista except using Virtual PC 2007.
