I find they provide two screensavers there. However, I cannot install them both. I have to choose between them which is very very hard.

Again, the site has no place to report this issue. It seems the developers are confident about their work. Yep, I am glad to see the beautiful UI, but I believe there are more issues behind the scene.

Did you meet such issues at similar sites? Could you report the issues? Iâ€™d like to know your experiences.
