I was about to release the 1011 build as Final, but due to the fact that it is still in bad need of further tests I decide to release it as a Release Candidate this evening. The code base was frozen last Sunday, and will only accept bug fixes in these two or three weeks.

I have to update the documents for the 6.0 Final so there are a lot of tasks ahead of me now. Nearly all pictures need to be updated while a few new sections should be added into Readme and Manual. So wish again that I could finish by the end of this month.

Stay tuned.
