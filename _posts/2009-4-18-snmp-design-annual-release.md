Oh, itâ€™s drawing near. As the first change set of #SNMP was alive here on April 26th 2008, I plan to release something important one year later. Well, actually when I started this small project, how could I expect it would grow to be what it looks like today?

I just submitted the latest change set which contains my final changes for 2.0. If other team members do not submit patches next week, you will see a final 2.0 CrossRoad release.

Stay tuned.
