(CSDN July 17, 2006)

A few features are actually not that useful for normal users (some should be helpful for OTA designers), so they are turn off since this preview version.
<!--more-->

Most features are the same as last version, NixNewNer Update 1, because I have no plenty of time to add some more. I begin to test more features in order to deliver a more stable version soon.

Some vulnerabilities are found when using NUnit to test the project. Some are really naive mistakes I made. When more test cases are added, I believe more bugs will be found and fixed.

If you are a user, you should not be able to feel these changes, because I keep the interface untouched. Actually, although a new Minus is added, the project seems the same.

Wish more time I can afford this summer on this project to finish testing and Live Help.

This time I find InDate 2 is working just fine. Wish I could make it better when HardQuery Final is out.

Stay tuned.
