Danny Thorpe left Microsoft (Windows Live Team) last month and joined CoolIris, the company who gives birth to PicLens.

He is still monitoring Borland/CodeGear newsgroup, so this week I finally knew how class helper is created by reading these words he wrote.

Chuck really blew the doors off convention when he realized that it was also possible to implement true polymorphism with virtual methods in class helpers, with some additional compiler work and critical simplifying assumptions. Microsoft's C# extension methods serve a purpose similar to Delphi class helpers, but C# extension methods don't venture into virtual methods.

It seems that Danny is quite [satisfied](http://dannythorpe.com/2007/10/21/on-leaving-borland/) with this new job, so let's see what would come from CoolIris in the future.

Good luck, Danny.
