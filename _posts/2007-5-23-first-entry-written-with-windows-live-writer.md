I have been wondering if Blogger.com offers a client side blogging tool but only an Emacsâ€™s addin is found.

However, CodeGear employee Steve Trefethen talked about Windows Live Writer yesterday. Okay, I downloaded and installed it. Now I am using it to author a blog entry. It works just fine.

One of my friends now works in the Live Search team. However, he never tells me about Writer. Maybe now I can inform him.
