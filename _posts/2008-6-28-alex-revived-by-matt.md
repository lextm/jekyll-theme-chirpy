Although I have stated several times at different places, I'd like to do it once again, because Matt Everson helped update Alex to support SharpDevelop 3.0. Thank you, Matt.

So from now on, when you check out latest source code from Alex homepage, you get #D 3 support immediately. In order to help those users who cannot compile from source code, a BETA installer is uploaded here.

If you like, please visit Matt's own project here. That's a wonderful add in.

Stay tuned.
