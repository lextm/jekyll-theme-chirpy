Today I am happy to announce M8 of Code Beautifier Collection 6.0. It adds new features as well as fixes bugs.

The changes are,

1. A standalone JCF style editor is derived from original JCFNotepad. This enables you edit Object Pascal code style.
1. Issue 4 is resolved.
1. An uninstallation issue is fixed.
1. InDate count down time is reduced to 3 seconds.
1. [NDpend's FileDirectoryPath](http://www.codeplex.com/FileDirectoryPath) library is used to simplify path manipulation.

You can download it from here.
