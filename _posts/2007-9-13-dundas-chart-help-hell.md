I thought Dundas Chart was great, so I recommended my company bought it. However, when I installed and used it, I found the help in fact helpless sometimes.

I can provide an easy example. When a user change chart parameters which results in a refresh, the axis by default is not changed. This is tolerant but there must be a way to change the axis.

I think this is a common case, but I cannot find any information in ChartArea class overview or Axis class overview. Only when I navigate to ChartArea class members, a ReCalc method is there.

How I miss TeeChart for .NET. Not just the convenient default actions (axis recalculation), but also a nice help.

Also I cannot edit Dundas Chart components in SharpDevelop, my favorite .NET editor.
