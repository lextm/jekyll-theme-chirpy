I was planning to release 6.0 Final as a X'mas present. And then I delayed it as a new year present. However, even now I am not sure whether I can be on time to deliver it as a Chinese new year present because I am still not confident of the quality.

After listening to the podcast "The Register: Open Season", I suddenly found that if I released a poor quality 6.0 again, I would have done something wrong and hurt the open source movement. I don't care that much about my personal reputation because I am so young that I have a long path to pursue so as to build it up.

Stay tuned. I will try my best even though this time my time is so limited.
