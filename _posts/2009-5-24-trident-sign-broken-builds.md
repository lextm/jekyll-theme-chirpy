Is it OK to follow #SNMP builds at CodePlex.com? Probably not. The reason is quite simple, that I just can guarantee the builds can be compiled and that's all.

When I started to add SNMP v3 support, suddenly I noticed that a lot must be changed and no easy way available to keep everything fine. And as some users noticed, the browser in latest builds fails to work.

I have a plan to fix every broken pieces, but that will only happen in June. Please wait till then if you need a new browser to play with. In my opinion, the one in 2.0 (also 2.1) is good enough for basic usage.

Stay tuned.
