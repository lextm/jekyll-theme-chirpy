Because of our latest contributors, this project has a chance to improve in the following areas,

1. Performance. Currently Chris already provides a lot of patches to boost performance. We shall see more patches coming.
1. Compiler. I think I can help enhance the GUI, but the key point is the underlying compiler engine. So Patrick and Robert will work on that.
1. Browser. Steve and I will continue to work on the Browser. Hope that we can finish the remaining items such as the notification panel and load/unload.

Stay tuned.
