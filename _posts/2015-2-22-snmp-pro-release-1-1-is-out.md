Of course, #SNMP Pro has an important update too, which I announce at this moment. Yes, it is the 1.1 release of both the MIB Compiler Pro and SharpSnmpPro.Mib assembly.

The changes (compared to the initial release on Feb 3rd, 2014) are as below,

The online documentation at http://help.sharpsnmp.com is going to be updated very soon, due to some technical issues.

The offline version can be downloaded from Dropbox. Stay tuned.
