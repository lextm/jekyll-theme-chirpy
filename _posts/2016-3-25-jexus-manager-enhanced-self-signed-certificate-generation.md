IIS Manager has a shortcut in Server Certificates page to create self-signed certificates, aka "Create Self-Signed Certificateâ€¦" menu item under Actions. By clicking this menu item, a wizard pops up.

Once a friendly name is given and a store is chosen (Personal or Web Hosting), IIS will create a self-signed certificate with the following properties,

1. Valid for one year.
1. CN is set to the host name of the machine.
1. SHA1RSA signed.
1. 2048 bits.
<!--more-->

As we know, the above settings are quite limited these days, as SHA1 is obsolete and we often need to set CN to another value. Can there be a better tool?

Jexus Manager is such a clone of IIS Manager, that it also has a Server Certificates page. But its certificate wizard is much more powerful. You see, almost all options you want to tune are present.

Enjoy it.
