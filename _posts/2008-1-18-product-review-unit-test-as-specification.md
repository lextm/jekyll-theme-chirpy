I am going to continue using NUnit, but have to say NSpec is wonderful because it makes writing unit tests more fun. Why should we call the items "Test Cases" or `[Test]` when they can be called nicely as `[Specification]`? Even though it is just a term change, it makes unit test more feasible to my dear managers who know nothing of modern programming.

Next time when you start to write one more unit test case, breathe, and tell yourself, "now I need one more specification for my application." In this way you may enjoy a nice day. At least that's how I spend this valuable Friday.
