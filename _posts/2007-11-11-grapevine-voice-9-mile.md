Yes, 8 Mile-stone has been out there a couple of weeks. And it has the top download count now (579) while M5 is the second.

Now, M9 is coming. Following Paint.NET’s rule — release soon, release often, this release only contains two big changes,

1. AddMany Plus is back. Thanks to [AddMany](http://cc.codegear.com/Item/23368) 5.2’s author, dear Mauro.
1. Installer is updated. But the Install-For-All-Users is marked as experimental, not yet stable and complete.

You can always find the installer at [CBC Homepage](http://code.google.com/p/lextudio).
