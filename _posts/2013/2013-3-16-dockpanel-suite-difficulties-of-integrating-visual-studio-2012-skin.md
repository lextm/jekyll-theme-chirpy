A picture can save me a thousand words :) This week I merged more patches into the new skin branch, and now the sample looks more beautiful. But I really want feedback on the changes I made on the architecture (as we have to allow DockWindow and SplitterControl to be extendable).

Some of the changes are really significant, so I think we need more time to evaluate whether they should be included in our next 2.8 release. Personally I rather release them as part of 3.0 release, which is scheduled to include some controllable breaking changes.

Stay tuned.
