Just started to dig on Linux/Mono side, as the changes we made on the 8.0 way are so huge. In a few minutes, a serious problem was found,

http://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3055

Not sure how long it will take to have this issue resolved, but it makes our Linux support bit of tough. However, more issues may be ahead, as I am not sure whether SharpDevelop text editor works fine on Mono. In the coming days I will test more on Mono side and report more issues to Mono guys.

Stay tuned.
