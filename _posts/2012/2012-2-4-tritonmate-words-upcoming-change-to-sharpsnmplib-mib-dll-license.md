As you already know, in #SNMP 8.0 (upcoming release), the MIB compiler will be ANTLR based. Besides this technology change, I would like to also introduce a license change.

In the past, SharpSnmpLib.Mib.dll is licensed under LGPL. From 8.0 on, this assembly (most of it has been rewritten) will be released under BSD 3 Clause. For the code we reuse from the original assembly, I have contacted all contributors, and received confirmations from them. Thanks for their support on making this license change possible.

Stay tuned.
