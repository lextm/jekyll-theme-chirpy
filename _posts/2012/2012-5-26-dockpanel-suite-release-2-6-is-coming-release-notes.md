* Patch 3118287: Fix for unable to move splitter after hide.
* GitHub work item #1: ActiveContentChanged Doesn't Fire When Many DockPanels Exist in Application.
* GitHub work item #2: Heavily Nested Controls Do Not Resize With DockContent.
* GitHub work item #7: Should Work on Mono/Linux/Mac with Minimal Feature Set.
* First signed release with NuGet package deployment.

The binaries and source code packages will be published to GitHub Download page,
