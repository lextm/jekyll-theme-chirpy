openSUSE 11.2

NEW
IDE does not handle app.config in Visual Studio/SharpDevelop way
The workaround is to manually build using xbuild. I think when MD starts to use xbuild the issue is resolved automatically.

NEW
Why SocketException with ErrorCode == 10035 means Operation timed out? It breaks .NET compatibility
The workaround is to test whether Mono is in use and then check against 10035 or 10060.

System.NotSupportedException from System.Drawing.GDIPlus.CheckStatus (Status status) for #SNMP Agent
The workaround is to ignore the icon file for snmpd.exe main form.

"cannot be inferred from the usage" when compiling #SNMP
The workaround is to convert LINQ expression back to normal lines.

xbuild does not honor extra tag
Well, at least MD or xbuild compiles the solution without any error. I just remember to build periodically from Windows to update the version numbers.

xbuild cannot create folders
The workaround is to manually create those folders.
