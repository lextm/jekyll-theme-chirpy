Finally I think it is time to release Alex under a real open source license. Therefore, now the whole source code is released under MIT license. You can play with it if you like in almost any way. Hope you enjoy this change.

You may notice that right now StyleCop Addin for SharpDevelop is part of the default distribution of SD 3. So why not submit Alex to SD? My consideration is that SD already has a default format algorithm, so Alex may not add values to all its users. Therefore, I rather keep it a separate project at this moment. But if the SD team want to merge Alex inside, I can do whatever it takes.

Until now, I do not receive any mail from SD team members yet, so my guess is that they are not interested in Alex.
