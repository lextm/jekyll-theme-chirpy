(CSDN July 26, 2006)

I have to say that we are not lucky enough. GForge service is not available today. As a result, though I made a build just a minute before, I would not publish it. I will not try Borland Developer Network, because it is just a preview.

However, this preview will be available much later, since I will be back home today from college. Latest preview will be published when I come back.

Wish myself a good vacation.
