I have installed and uninstalled Visual Studio 2005/2008 several times without tough problems until suddenly I cannot install Microsoft SQL Server 2005 any more. That installation seems crushed and cannot be easily restored.

On MSDN forums, it is not hard to find similar reports about failures of installing Microsoft products, such as .NET Framework, .NET SDK.

And CodeGear at last finds out that using InstallAware to build Delphi setup is still buggy.

What happens? It seems that all MSI based installations are not stable enough! Yes, even though my project powered by InstallAware is small and easy, it just takes so long to install which causes a lot of complaints from my representatives.

Should Microsoft improve MSI badly now? I am on bended knees.
