InstallAware and CodeGear has been blamed because RAD Studio installation is really slow. But I am still believing that Microsoft holds the key.

I am really disappointed that installing December Update takes me three hours on Windows Vista Home Basic with rollback off. But after all, I met only one warning (some file was missing). After clicking Retry, everything went on well.

It seems that I am still a lucky man while others meet issues when installing this Update. Am I that lucky? I just follow the official measures available on CDN.

In fact, I think InstallAware is better because I remember that original CD/DVD is required if you want to install Delphi 8/2005/2006 (correct me if I am wrong).

So now, I can focus on GrapeVine Final and try to deliver it as soon as possible.
