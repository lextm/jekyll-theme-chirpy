I have written about Jexus in the past several times. Now I combine most of the posts to a single Readme doc on GitHub, and also write out a release notes doc there.

* https://github.com/jexuswebserver/jexus-contrib/blob/master/releasenotes.en.md

I am going to write a new doc about IIS/Jexus feature by feature matrix to illustrate the similarity and differences between the two web servers designed for ASP.NET. Stay tuned.
