When I was developing HardQuery R2 Update 3, I thought I should move to MSBuild completely because NAnt would be no longer active.

But today, I saw [a post on Monologue](http://www.mono-project.com/news/archive/2007/Dec-08.html) that announces new NAnt and suddenly found that I was absolutely wrong. So why this project goes live again?

I tried xbuild which is part of Mono and clone of MSBuild targeting non-Windows platforms and the latest implementation was not ready for my usage.

So NAnt is still the best choice on non-Windows platform before xbuild goes older. According to [the release notes](http://nant.sourceforge.net/release/0.86-beta1/releasenotes.html), this new version is very promising.

BTW, I always think the guys should create an icon for NAnt!
