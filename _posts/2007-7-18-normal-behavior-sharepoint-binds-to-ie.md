My team uses a SharePoint site to communicate. The problem is that I cannot use Firefox to enjoy all features of the site. Many features such as discussion can only be available when browsing in IE.

In China, using IE to explore the Internet is proved to be dangerous, and using Firefox or Netscape is recommended by our IT guys. However, except Windows Update there are other ways MS can prevent you from using another web browser.

Stop this MS, or I will give up Windows completely.

(Updated: Why using IE in China is dangerous? Many crackers in China who write spyware and viruses for money prefer to make use of IE vulnerabilities. I know Firefox has vulnerabilities too but only a few Chinese use Firefox so FF-specific viruses or spyware is rare.)
