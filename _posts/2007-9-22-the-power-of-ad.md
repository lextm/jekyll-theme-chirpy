Sometimes it is hard to convince myself to do some AD for Code Beautifier Collection, and I have so little knowledge on how to publish AD. But this time, with the help of Google Analytics I see the power of AD. Surprising!
<!--more-->

On September 19 I published a small AD about Code Beautifier Collection 6.0 M5 on CodeGear newsgroup to announce support to RAD Studio 2007. And I never thought that on September 20 there were 110 visitors to CBC Homepage from all around the world. Never believe there were so many counts from Russia and Ukraine. *

There are a lot of things I did not do this time to make a complete AD,

1. There is no screen shot.
1. There is even no direct link to CBC Homepage. I just publish the link to Code Central ID of CBC. http://cc.codegear.com/Item/24010
1. There is no line about any feature of CBC. One user reminded me of this last month but because of my poor memory I failed to make it this time.**

Forgive me if I messed up this time. Next time I will be more careful.

> \* Forget to mention that ArtCSB author, Artyom Fedyuk, comes from Ukraine. And now ArtCSB has been a Plus of CBC with some out-of-date features removed. Artyom, I owe you so much. Because I cannot contact you by the mail address you left in ArtCSB readme file, I'd like to say thank you so much here.
