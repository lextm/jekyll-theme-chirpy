Now I am looking at new icon sets for major operating systems that probably would ship with Firefox 3 Beta 3 and go to the Final. Oh, they are fabulous.

Something interesting is that the only characters in them are Chinese (no English characters there in the icons).

The leftmost two icons are for Windows (XP and Vista) which contain the Chinese character for fox (狐) while the rightmost icon for Linux contains page (页).
