I used to use RAVE Report and TeeChart to do reporting tasks on Delphi land. But now switched to .NET field, I found so many solutions including one that provided by Microsoft, RDL.

In a glance, RDL is not amazing. However, compared to other solutions, RDL is XML based open standard. You can not understand Crystal Reportâ€™s format, but you can read RDL always.

It is hard to believe MS has begun to change in some aspects, but it is good. Maybe some day other reporting solutions will turn to use RDL instead of their private format.
