(CSDN May 29, 2006)

After a busy week end, I am glad to see some important features ready to ship.
<!--more-->

1. AutoCompletion. Some really frequent-used pairs are not included in BDS default. So now I add them.
1. A simplest Input Helper. Whenever you type the first three letters of a word, it kicks off Code Insight.
1. New LeXDK Developer’s Guide. Updated to meet so many changes.

All except the second feature can be found in Homepage’s Files | Latest Builds.

20060529.zip contains Update 2 RC 2.

The RC 3 will be ready soon.
