I have to confess Windows Live Writer (WLW) is so good that I will never write a post in browser again.

However, the default installation lacks of a few functions, such as no smiley, no table, no source code support. This is very annoying.

You can get all missing functions [here](http://gallery.live.com/results.aspx?bt=9&pl=8). Yes, in fact there are so many useful plug ins. Maybe I could make my own ones later.
