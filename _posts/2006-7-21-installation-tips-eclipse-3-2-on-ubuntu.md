It is not hard to find that Eclipse 3.2 has been available for a long time. However, you can not find a 3.2 deb on China local Ubuntu repository (all that I got is 3.1.2). So, I try another way.

1. download the gtk2 version of eclipse for Linux.
1. make sure you install sun-java5-jre and make it default JVM on your Ubuntu. It is not hard, too. Ubuntu.org.cn has a nice article on this issue.
1. unzip the tar.gz you download to a folder, for me I choose /home/lextm. It should be a folder eclipse containing all files needed.
1. make a desktop shortcut. The link should be /home/lextm/eclipse/eclipse.
1. then run this shortcut and Eclipse 3.2 should be launched.
For me, it is quite okay.

What is missing is how to install Java 6. I will solve this issue soon.

Stay tuned.
