I love UAC. If you find it boring, I guess you never use Ubuntu, a popular Linux distribution before. At last Windows Vista learns something from other more secure operating systems.

But it is rather boring if some applications need elevations all the times. And this morning when I read a post on Wintellog I saw a workaround.

Yes, now I can add eMule and Workrave to the list.

(Update: Workrave nightly builds are already supporting Vista better so this workaround is no longer necessary. Thanks, Otto.)
