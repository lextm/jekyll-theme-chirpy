I thought I had grown up to an adult, but my mom denied it. She insisted that I be an adult only if I were more than 30. This short dialog happened last weekend, but now it seems years ago.

I am so young, young enough to make mistakes, deliberately or indeliberately, and gain experience from them. But am I always innocent? Am I always free of responsibility?

What happens this weekend makes me suffer a lot today, and I am not sure if the last thing I expected would come true next week. It is really tough for me to carry on so much burden, but only this time I know my responsibilities more clearly. Iâ€™ll do whatever it takes to fulfill my destiny.

I have faith in me that finally a win-win will come if I try my best.
