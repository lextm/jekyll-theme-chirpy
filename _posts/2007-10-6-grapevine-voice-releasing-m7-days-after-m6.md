I thought that I had fixed issue 2 on CBC Homepage. However, I soon found issue 3. You can read the comment to see what silly mistake I made. So sorry to bother you all again. GrapeVine M7 is now available on the download list so you can download and install it.

Please read this post if you are still using Milestones before M6. All notice items apply to M7 too.

Stay tuned.
