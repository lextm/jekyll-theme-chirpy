Last time when I updated the user interface of InDate, Plus Manager and Expert Manager, I did a lot of refactorings to improve Plus Manager. However, I did nothing in Expert Manager.

This time after logging a new issue here, I think itâ€™s time to work on Expert Manager again to simplify the source code there.

Most changes were done and tested this Wednesday, so I am going to commit them into SVN repository this weekend.

I am still evaluating if a June Release is possible. Stay tuned.
