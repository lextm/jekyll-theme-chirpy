Code Beautifier Collection 5.3.3 is now ready to reach you.

The following features are implemented or enhanced in this version,

1. \* Delegate type support is added in Source Navigator.
1. \+ XML comments support is added in Typing Speeder for C#.
1. \+ Icon Browser is added as a new feature.
1. \* Disabled pluses assemblies are no longer loaded.
1. \+ Line Counter feature is added.

You can download the installation file from here.

Sorry for the delay (about three months).

Because I do not have plenty of time, you should refer to Change Logs section in Readme.pdf to understand what the new features are. The manual.pdf is in fact out-of-date.

Soon a GrapeVine preview will be released and the term HardQuery will phase out.
