DLR enables Python and Ruby on .NET platform. But the Java/Groovy issue comes again. Although IronPython and IronRuby can call C# code, the reverse is not possible now.

According to this post, in the next version of Visual Studio (as well as .NET Framework) extensions of C# will enable better communication between C# and DLR.

I never used dynamic languages before, but I wish a dynamic C# can bring me joy because the current reflection is so complicated.
