CodeGear uses Interwise technology to host online live training sessions. I joined one session in September about Delphi for .NET Generics. And just right now I joined Luke Fanâ€™s session on Blackfish.

Have to say the first experience is fine because so many people joined and the topic is hot. However, the second one is not pleasant. Both of Luke and I are in China. Therefore using a North America centric hosting system made the connection so fragile that it broke several times.

Another important thing is the telephone numbers. When you dial it outside North America, it charges you. Sad that it is not really international.

Now I am looking forward to the session given by Gordon Li which is due to December 19th. ECO for VCL for .NET should be a fine topic.
