Well, although this RC3 bit missed its original target day seriously (according to [this post](/snmp-design-the-first-performance-analysis-fa3b7f884253) and [this one](/snmp-design-changes-from-steve-and-latest-news-2a448a7568a7), it might have been released in October), it did bring a lot more.

Stay tuned.
