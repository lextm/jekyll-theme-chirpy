The version number of SharpDevelop has been changed to 2.2 (on the build server), which means there is one more version between 2.1 and 3.0. The changes are not so visible that I noticed the version number update three days after installation.

Even though not a version listed in the roadmap, it is welcome. I love SharpDevelop. It is so small and fast responding. Compared to SD, Visual Studio 2005 is just a slow-moving monster. The only advantage of VS is that more add-ins for it is available.
