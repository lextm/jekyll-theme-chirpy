Back in 2010 [I wrote about using lite mode of DPS on Mono](/dockpanel-suite-tip-5-we-could-go-mono-63ee484f77a0).

Today I announce a better lite mode implementation,

* Built on DPS 2.5 (latest revision in SVN trunk)
* Full feature on Windows/.NET (drag and drop is supported)
* Lite mode on Mono (drag and drop is not supported)

Note that you need to use Win32Helper.IsRunningOnMono() to detect Mono in your applications and disable drag and drop pro-actively.

Source code is available on GitHub,

https://github.com/lextudio/sharpsnmplib/tree/7.5/WinFormsUI

Tested in #SNMP project on both Windows 7 (.NET) and openSUSE (Mono).

Hope the maintainers of DPS can merge the changes into the official repository for everyone.

(Updated: Now I become a maintainer of DockPanel Suite. The latest DPS can be found at https://github.com/dockpanelsuite/dockpanelsuite, which contains this patch and many other useful patches.)
