Well, I am back. This time I will not only provide news and forum support, but work on both the library and the compiler as well.

# New Member
Then we have another developer now. Welcome, Rick Born (did I mention that he is Steve’s boss?) :) I didn’t have a chance to talk with Rick yet, so I am not sure which component in #SNMP he is most interested in.

# Latest Changes
Steve and I checked in a few changes this weekend, so we are getting near to RC 3 for TwinTower. We closed a few Work Items and something new. You may read the check in notes for hints.

But the key change is that Steve back ported the source code to C# 2.0, so now #SNMP can be used in Visual Studio 2005 directly. I know some of you have been waiting for this long enough. So now you can check it out from the repository.

# Next Step
Next weekend, I am going to release RC3. Stay tuned.
