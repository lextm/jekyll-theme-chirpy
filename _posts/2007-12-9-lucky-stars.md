I still love one of Britney Spears songs named ‘Lucky’. And one of these days I watched Disney’s movie ‘High School Musical 2’ and met those ‘lucky stars’ again in 2007.

I guess the power of old media such as TV channels, newspapers, music industry and film makers has been weakened by Internet, but still that power keeps updating our vision with new guys.

Who will be the next Zac Efron (Troy Bolton) or Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) that makes every young guy jealous?
