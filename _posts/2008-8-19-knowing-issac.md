As a not-too-bad singer, I like to collect instrumental version of songs. And it was last summer that I came across Issac's blog when I tried to search instrumental version of Iris. Although his guitar version was not as perfect as the original, his words moved me a lot.

I never have a chance to visit Hong Kong, but thanks to those posts I can see a snapshot of the city through Issac's eyes. Hong Kong is far from Shanghai, but it is surprising that Issac and I suffers similar pains.

Hope I can know him better.
