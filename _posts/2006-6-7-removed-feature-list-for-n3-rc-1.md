I wanted to try some features in RC 1 release, but there were a lot of problem and they were removed.
<!--more-->

Yes, sometimes I use IOTAEditActions to invoke CodeCompletion or CodeTemplate, they fails without ant clue.

So there is no more using or new + Space functions, no `“,’,[,(` matchings.

Input Helper will be disabled also.

I will make the RC 1 visible soon on the homepage.
