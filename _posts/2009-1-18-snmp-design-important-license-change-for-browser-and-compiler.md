I think MIT is a better choice so letâ€™s stop using BSD.

Please notice this change affects our latest source code in the repository. It is a little bit late for TwinTower.

In this way, developers who want to incorporate some of our code into GPL projects may be happy.

The license for our core library remains the same. LGPL 2.1 should be nice.
