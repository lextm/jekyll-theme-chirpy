After three months of further hacking and effective collaboration with some of the contributors, Ryan and I are proud to announce the 2.7 release of DockPanel Suite.
<!--more-->

More information (such as release notes) can be found on the homepage at http://dockpanelsuite.com, and the following are the highlighted items,

1. Better Mono support — A major stackoverflow issue has been remedied. We provide Mono guys a bug report.
1. Better .NET Framework Client Profile support — Removed dependency on System.Design.
1. Better middle mouse click support — Middle clicking now works in more places.
1. Less rendering issues — Missing docking indicator issue should occur less frequently. Deep nested control rendering can be disabled to improve performance.

As usual, you can grab the binaries from

NuGet, http://nuget.org/packages/DockPanelSuite
GitHub, https://github.com/downloads/dockpanelsuite/dockpanelsuite/DockPanel_2_7_0.zip
The source code is also available on GitHub.
