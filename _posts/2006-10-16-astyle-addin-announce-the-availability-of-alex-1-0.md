What is Alex? It is just AStyle AddIn for SharpDevelop version 1.0. Because I am now using SD 2.1, this version solely for that.

Finally I have added an options dialog since I created those betas. So in this version you can configure AStyle as you like. Most of CBC code on AStyle is used. As a result, it is not hard to make all implemented.

Try it now if you have been waiting for long.
