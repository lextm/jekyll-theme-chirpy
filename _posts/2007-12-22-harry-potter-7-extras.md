The seventh should be an end but it seems that J.K. Rowling did hide a few stories somewhere. So an encyclopedia may come some day to reveal those hidden stories about dark, hope, and love.

When I touched the first book (Simplified Chinese translation) in 2002, I never thought that this series could give me so much joy all through the years, especially when the future is unclear.

Thanks, Ms. Rowling.
