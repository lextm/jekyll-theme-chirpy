My trip to Sao Paulo were delayed because Cisco do Brasil met some troubles. You may already read about the news on Slashdot.org. Thus, I would probably arrive in the end of November.

Now I am sure I can bring with me Harry Potter 7 Chinese version because I received it this Monday. The translation is nice and while I was reading no obvious errors are found.

I am looking forward to the trip although taking the yellow fever bacterin shot is not pleasant.
