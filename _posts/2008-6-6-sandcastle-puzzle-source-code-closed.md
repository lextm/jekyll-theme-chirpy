I was happy to see Microsoft hosted Sandcastle on CodePlex.com. I believed once this half baked NDoc alternative got open source, .NET developers could enjoy happiness that NDoc was bringing in the past.

I was wrong and MSFT ate its word. Sandcastle was removed from CodePlex.com. So many days have passed but no Sandcastle code has been released under an open source license. And according to CodePlex rules, Sandcastle should have been removed a few months ago.
