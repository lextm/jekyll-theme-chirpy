I have been forced to give up Windows Live Writer (for my Blogger account), SF.net and SVNBridge (for Alex and #SNMP on CodePlex) at home. According to some rumors, that all ISPs here must limit access to certain Internet materials. Therefore, I am sad.

The everyday tasks I can no longer do in a few months are,

1. Check in changes of #SNMP and Alex.
1. Write posts in WLW and publish directly.
1. Keep a track of updates on SF.net.

So sad.
