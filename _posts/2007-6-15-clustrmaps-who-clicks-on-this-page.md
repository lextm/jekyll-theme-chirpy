It is interesting to see where do the visitors of this blog come from with ClustrMaps. I never knew my blog was read by Europeans, Americans, and Indians until I checked the record this Monday.

The mechanism behind may be simple (IP resolution), but the result is very useful and interesting (encouraging me to blog more).

And what is amazing is that this service is now free (you can pay for advanced features). You can set your map up on ClustrMaps.com.
