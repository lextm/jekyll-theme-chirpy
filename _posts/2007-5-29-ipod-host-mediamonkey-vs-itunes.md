I have bought a iPod Video 2. Since so many people complains about iTune's performance, I have been frightened and decided to use something else.

And luckily, in Nick Hodges' blog, I found MediaMonkey, a Delphi written product. I will give it a try as soon as I get my Dell notebook.

BTW, KMPlayer is also written in Delphi.

(Updated: I am now using MediaMonkey all the time. It runs very well. According to its manual, more functions with iPod is provided by MediaMonkey than iTune.)
