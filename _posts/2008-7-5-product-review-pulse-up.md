I did try Pulse a long time ago, but I was not happy with that. However, after Eclipse 3.4 announcement I tried Pulse again, and the new version, is excellent!

I just could believe so many things were changed by the team,

* The performance for non-broadband computers like mine is fine tuned. Since multi-thread/site download is supported, this time I can finally install Eclipse RCP via Pulse.
* The user interface looks nicer.
* This time more add-ons are available.

I guess I would no longer download Eclipse without Pulse :-)

(Updated: please notice if you want to use Pulse free, you should read the first comment below carefully to make yourself comfortable :-))
