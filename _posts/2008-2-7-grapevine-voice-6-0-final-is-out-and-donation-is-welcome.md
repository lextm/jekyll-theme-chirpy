I have just released the GrapeVine Final as version 6.0.0.1014. After unsuccessful M11 and M12, I decide to skip M13. That is why the final release is the 14th build.
<!--more-->

Major changes are,

1. \+ Vista look and feel and task dialogue is used wherever suitable.
1. \+ Vista UAC compliant.
1. \* Installation experience is improved.
1. \+ Object Pascal code style editor is added.
1. \* All bugs reported to Google Code homepage are Ô¨Åxed.

This is new About dialogue. You may notice there is one more button. Yes, now you can donate to this project. Finally I set up a PayPal account for Code Beautifier Collection.

You can also donate via my blog by clicking the Donate button.

From now on I can start to enjoy my holidays.
