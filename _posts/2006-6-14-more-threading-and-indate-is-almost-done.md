.NET threading is not quite hard, if you only use a few threads. For example, two or three threads are used in InDate (in Integrated mode three threads, standalone mode two).

In order to make the textbox unlocked when updating, I saw to SDK document and found a DirectorySearcher sample.

It is amazing that this sample tells just what I need. And I know a little about Control class by the way. After reading and modifying the source, I turn my Updater.cs into a user control and slightly edit FormInDate. Then it goes just fine.

I think only two threads are needed when integrated mode is set. I will see to that soon.
