I know Hydra is a snake with nine heads. But do you know the "Bird of Nine Heads"? That is a sacred symbol of my homeland. Therefore, to celebrate the birth of the very first #SNMP full feature release, 0.9, I named this release NineHeaded. And now it is there so why not play with it?

Major changes introduced in this month contains,

1. A simple MIB parser that can parse an object tree from a bunch of MIB documents.
1. A few improvements on the programming interface.

From now on, I am going to write more samples and documentation on how to use #SNMP for the 1.0 release, code named UnicornHorn. Stay tuned.
