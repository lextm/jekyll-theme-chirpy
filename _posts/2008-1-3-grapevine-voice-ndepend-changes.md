“CQL constraints violations highlighted in report” was once a feature available in Trial/Academic/Open Source Edition of NDepend and now is no longer there. Thus, I have to manually check the CQL results in VisualNDepend. In this way I guess I could not finish GrapeVine Final by the end of January. Therefore, I freeze the code base today. I will continue to test all features by capturing pictures everywhere. In the last iteration I found this method more efficient than expected because I can both test the code and prepare the documents. I am not a skilled tester, so as usual I could only guarantee the common issues be caught in the act.

Stay tuned.
