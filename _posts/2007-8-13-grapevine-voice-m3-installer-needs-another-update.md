According to bug report I received today from Dear Tom, I have updated M3 installer on Google Code.

Please first uninstall the ‘old M3’ and install this ‘new M3’ instead.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

(Update: It seems Tom still cannot install M3 correctly. So I decide to clean up my notebook so as to set up a test environment later this week. Please turn back to M2 installation if you could and wait till I test M3 installer completely.

Because now I have less time than usual on coding and testing, forgive me if I made silly mistakes. My intentions were good.)
