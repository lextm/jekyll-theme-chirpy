When I tried XPS Essentials Pack 1.0, I found it similar to PDF. Yes, what is missing is a Acrobat product line (I didn't try the Expressions, so maybe I was wrong).

So, now Microsoft is fighting against Adobe in any way,

* Silverlight vs. Flex,
* Expression Studio vs. Creative Suite,
* XPS vs. PDF,

Who will win? I have a guess. Who wins developers' hearts who wins at last.

Visual Studio and Expression Studio may provide some advantages over Adobe. Up-to-now, I see XPS format easier to manipulate than Adobe PDF format because it is XML based. I see XAML great for building GUI (also XML based), but Adobe fails to provide a similar language. Even at this moment, I see no easy way to set up a development environment for Adobe technology (I am not a Java guy, so if Eclipse supports Adobe technology please let me know).

IMHO, Microsoft has more experience in this field â€” winning developers, so although Adobe starts as the dominator, it may lose in the end.

BTW, I am not quite biased even if I use Visual Studio 2005 every day. I am just wishing Adobe could learn from Microsoft in certain aspects, make it easy to learn and develop with its technology.
