It is so wonderful that Google holds Summer of Code every year. After subscribing to Monologue, I can see how SoC helps Project Mono.

When those talent students join the projects during the summer, we can nearly always expect Wows in the fall.

This summer an experimental WinForms designer for MonoDevelop is done and there are other nice things. I just cannot wait to see the long list of creations SoC triggers.

Why does Google support this kind of activities? Innovation. Yes, it changes the world.

We know Microsoft tries to do something but I never feel any changes its activities bring. Those innovations seem frozen once touched by Microsoft’s hands.

Sometimes I think this is why I prefer Google to Microsoft.
