I have been tightly bind to Reader for a long time since our Chinese ISP kindly started to block a lot of blog sites. I am pretty sure that RSS support in many web browsers and mail applications are really cool, but sadly they cannot fight against my ISP, can they? Therefore, utilizing powerful servers of a big company as my proxy is not a bad idea.

However, I always find it boring to use that "simple" UI from Google. I love simplicity but that does not mean I could not enjoy some awesome things sometimes. But now I have found what I want, Feedly.

This is a cool Firefox add-on that provides a magazine view of all feeds I subscribe to. So please install and try it out yourself.

Well, it works perfect even if I use FF 3.1b2. :)
