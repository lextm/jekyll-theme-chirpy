Finally we start to ship Trident 3.0 of #SNMP Suite. In this release the changes are,

1. SNMP v3 support added to the Library and the command line utilities.
1. *Message classes interface enhanced.
1. Classes and namespaces re-organized.
1. Obsolete items in 2.0 release removed.
1. Several bugs fixed.

This is an intermediate release as SNMP v3 support can be further enhanced. The Browser as well as the Compiler needs to be updated for v3 too. Therefore, the work for the next release will be started very soon. Hope that release can be ready by the new year eve. But who knows? :)
