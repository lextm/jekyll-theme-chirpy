In the group meeting today, I was assigned new tasks. It seems to be easy but hard in fact. I would take over one project from my mentor and start to update it and do bug fixing.

For a software developer, generally speaking, it is much easier to start new projects than maintaining othersâ€™ projects, especially when the code has bad smells. If you think refactoring will reduce the pains, you should be warned that enough tests must be done.

Because the project at this moment has no unit tests written, I have to say it is really challenging to refactor on the code. However, I am forced to clean up the code and simplify the logic because so many times I meet bad smells.

Wish everything goes fine after all.
