I know my blog cannot be accessed at home. I also know a lot of my friend cannot access it from other cities in China. And now I find out at last I cannot access it at office.

So how can I make a post now? And how can I see what I have posted? Luckily blogger.com domain is not filtered out so Windows Live Writer is still working and I can use Google Reader to subscribe to my own blog.

Wish some day we can have some precious freedom here.
