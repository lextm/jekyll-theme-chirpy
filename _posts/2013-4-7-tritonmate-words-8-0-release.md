While I am busy working on the closed source Compiler Pro, we do have some progress on open source side.
<!--more-->

Today I publish the release candidate of #SNMP 8.0, which contains significant new features,

* Better compliance with RFC documents (2574 and 3414).
* Official Xamarin platforms support (Mono, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android).
* Enhanced snmpd with ifTable implementation.
* Brand new BytesViewer sample.
* Project wide licensing change (from Lesser GPL to MIT/X11), except the MIB compiling portion (which is already re-licensed under BSD 3-Clause in 7.5 release).

Note that though the open source version of #SNMP MIB Compiler now contains significantly less features than the Pro edition, it still receives patches from the paid version, as the two still shares the same grammar file and a common code base.

Stay tuned.

(Updated: After releasing the RC build, no big issue is found, so today I mark it as RTW. Yes, the RC bits become final release.)

BTW, the Pro edition is now [in private beta](/snmp-pro-private-beta-is-ready-and-early-access-program-starts-7311b09abd8e).
