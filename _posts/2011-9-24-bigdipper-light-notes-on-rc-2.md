Today, I started typing the release notes for our next major release, BigDipper, or 7.0.

It is not yet fully finished, as for the removed/obsolete things I did not document all the workarounds for you. The help document is not yet compiled either.

However, I think the bits there are already very stable and will be turned over as 7.0 RTM in the coming weeks. So if you want to try out 7.0 as early as possible, it is time now.

Since I will travel a lot in the coming weeks too, I cannot tell on which day exact the RTM will be announced. Keep an eye here and stay tuned :)
