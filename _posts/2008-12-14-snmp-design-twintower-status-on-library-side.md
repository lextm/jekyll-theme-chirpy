Well, I can only say something about the Library. Steve will decide if there is anything else on the Browser side. Note that the Compiler will be surely Alpha until CrossRoad.

After marking up all the Obsolete methods, I am going to focus on the last piece, Manager.GetTable. So 1.5 is 99% ready on my side. If I cannot improve GetTable, any modification will be deferred to CrossRoad, too.

As far as I know, I own two Issues on the Browser numbered 3365 and 3403 (3408 is "won't fix"). I will stat to work on them lately. Stay tuned.
