It is quite funny that even though Microsoft wants Visual C++ and Visual Basic developers to move to C#, it does not provide certain classes in .NET that college students need. For example, when I was at college, I found that no serial port related classes were there in .NET 1.x (they are added until 2.0 such as SerialPort). Up to now, we donâ€™t see USB related classes yet in 3.5. Therefore, how can we do USB development easily?

Thus, how to manipulate USB easily? I recommend SharpUsbLib, a wrapper over libusb.

# Deployment

Since it is a wrapper, so when you deploy your application, libusb must be deployed besides SharpUsbLib. On Windows platform, you should use LibUsb-Win32. (Notice: it does not officially support Windows Server 2003, Vista, and Server 2008).

# Usage

Even though the demo project in SharpUsbLib does not read or write data through USB, it illustrates how to query Device instances connected to the PC. If you take a look at Device class, you can find I/O functions such as BulkRead, BulkWrite and so on. So it is in fact quite easy to learn and use in your applications.

# License

As a reminder, please notice that SharpUsbLib is published under GPL or LGPL. So if you want to use it in a commercial application, please follow the restrictions of LGPL carefully.
