I ordered a few volumes of Intel manuals and they arrived today by FedEx. Yes, the manuals are printed and packaged in great condition.

Although Microsoft provides a lot of PDF documents now, such as Office 2007 UI Design Guidelines and Windows Vista User Experience Guidelines, no printed version is available.

What about CBC's manuals? I could publish the PDF to Lulu.com some day. Then users can order printed versions from lulu instead.
