The RC bits of Jexus Manager 1.1 is now available. It adds a new page so that you can configure Jexus specific settings (which do not have corresponding pages in IIS Manager). 

> Currently an ugly icon is in use, which should be changed in final release.

Above is how this page looks like when you click the icon.

Since Jexus settings are stored as key-value pair, this simple editor allows you to modify the pairs freely and apply the changes at will when everything looks good to you.

Note that if you are not sure of any setting, you can click the Help link and navigate to our documentation site.

Enjoy it and stay tune. The final release should be available on 31 July.
