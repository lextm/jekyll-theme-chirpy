If you do an Internet search for this title, you will meet tons of posts/threads, and all such failures somehow are related to Microsoft Web Platform Installer. So is Web PI such a bad bad tool?

Nope. It may be just something else that blocks your way such as,

* Your anti-virus software
* Your network condition
* Your corrupt Windows system

Besides, the design of Web PI is to automatically download the installers and execute them quietly for you, which also prevents those installers from telling you what pre-conditions are not met. This sometimes makes the problem even worse.

Then how to install VWD the safest way? Microsoft happens to have an ISO file available here, http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-All. You can burn this to a disc, or load it in virtual drive to install VWD offline.

Good luck.
