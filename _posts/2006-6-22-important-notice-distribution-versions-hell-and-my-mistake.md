(CSDN June 22, 2006)

It is not easy to publish CBC to several sites, especially Borland Developer Network Code Central.

Now, 2ccc.com is the most important site for Chinese users, because this site is famous and fast to browse.

Borland Developer Network Code Central is the most important site for other users because 2ccc.com is pure Chinese.

I tried to apply a SF.net account but no response shows now. So GForge a Chinese site is used to publish latest builds of CBC.

Newest versions are uploaded to GForge site at first. There are a lot of unstable versions/RCs.

What you might need to notice is that Final versions on 2ccc.com or Borland Developer Network Code Central is not exactly the same as Final versions on GForge. For example, the NixNewNer 5.1 on Borland Developer Network Code Central was actually a N3 Update 1 RC. Today I update it to RC 5.

Once you know this, you understand that many issues in the old days are caused by this stupid action.

Also, since InDate, the auto-updater, is done, RC versions will have a distinct number to identify itself (at this moment, RC versions are the same as last Final version).

Versions hell, wish we could say farewell to it.
