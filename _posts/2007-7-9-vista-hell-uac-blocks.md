I have been using Ubuntu for a long time. Yep, I know it prompts me every time I try to make a big change. UAC is just a copy of that on Windows.

When I try to publish GrapeVine Preview, I find it blocks me. CBC saves the settings in Program Files which violates UACâ€™s rules.

In later versions, I will move the settings and .plus2 files to a user folder instead.

What Vista brings me is not only this problem. MiKTeX cannot update itself correctly. I have to say the compatibility is too poor.
