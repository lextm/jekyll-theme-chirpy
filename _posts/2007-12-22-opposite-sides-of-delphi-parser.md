If you read [this post](http://www.delphifeeds.com/go/f/30375/) you know that Daniel is searching for a native Delphi parser written in Delphi. And definitely, the comment there provides the best solution right now, [an open source parser](http://code.google.com/p/castaliadelphiparser/) contributed by Castalia author, Jacob.

I have been searching for Delphi parser too, but I cannot make use of Jacob's parser because I need something for .NET. If you take a look at HardQuery and GrapeVine source code you know that I was trying to parse Delphi by using Code DOM but that was not a pleasant trip. So when I read Daniel's post and found [DGrok](http://www.gumpi.com/Blog/ct.ashx?id=68d7e220-19d5-4118-991b-b5db56b01823&url=http%3A%2F%2Fexcastle.com%2Fblog%2Fcategory%2F2.aspx%3FShow%3DAll), I surely would try it.

Thanks, Daniel. Your question answers my question by accident. Merry X'mas.
