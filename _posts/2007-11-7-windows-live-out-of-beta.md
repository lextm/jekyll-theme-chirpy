Today Windows Live Team in MSFT releases a bunch of Live products, so the beta stage has passed. Nice to see the changes.

Yes, I am now using Writer 2008 to author this post. It looks nicer because I can set post date now for my Blogger account.

However, if you want to try this new products and have already used the betas for a long time, I suggest you manually uninstall the beta versions at first and then install this final releases. I have some troubles with the installer because it takes a relatively long time to update the installation for me.

Wish to see more new stuffs from this innovative team.
