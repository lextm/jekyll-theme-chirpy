Today I finally remember to subscribe to RSS of Mozilla Lab. Have to say the posts are fancy. I love the Prism idea, but at this moment it does not run on Simplified Chinese Windows. I love the current Weave, but I cannot afford running Firefox 3.0 Beta (because I use so many add-ons). I wish I could see more wonderful posts from this source in 2008.

One more thing is that it seems that Firefox can be a RCP too just like Eclipse. So I start to wonder how a future Firefox browser looks like?
