When log4net is used, the logs are text only. Most of the time I get confused when analyzing a large log file.

CodeSite is a great tool to remove this pain from your development. however, this time my company will not buy it. As a result, I have to find something similar but free.

Overseer for .NET is such a solution I come across when I search for ActionList for .NET. I tried the Delphi Win32 version a lot time ago, so will definitely give the .NET version a try.

Yes, using such a log analyzer, logs become eye candy. The icons help a lot to clarify different kind of messages.

Thanks for SharpPlus.
