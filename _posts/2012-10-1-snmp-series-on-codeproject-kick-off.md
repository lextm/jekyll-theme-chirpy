I was thinking about how to improve documentation on #SNMP. After a few weeks, the following decision is made,

* This blog will only publish project progress and quick glance on important features.
* The project Knowledge Base and FAQ will focus on all information (except "how-to").
* All "how-to" tips will be hosted on CodeProject as a series of short articles.

I did learn a lot from CodeProject, so it is time to give something back. Besides, it is reasonable to emphasize on the "how-to" portion at this stage, when the code base is relatively solid and stable. We need serious promotion to make #SNMP appealing to more .NET developers, and CodeProject has been approved to be such a place.

[The very first article](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/468892/An-introduction-to-sharpSNMP-an-Open-Source-SNMP) in this series has arrived here, and surprisingly it has been viewed for more than 500 times in the first 24 hours. That means a lot to me!

Stay tuned, as I will write more often on that series.
