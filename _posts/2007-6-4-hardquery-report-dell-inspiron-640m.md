I have bought such a computer half a month ago and it arrived last Saturday. The silver look is very amazing. I have to say this is the most expensive thing I own now (the 30G iPod Video 2 is second to it).

I do not think Vista Home Premium worth the money so I choose Vista Home Basic. Even with this version of Windows, the main memory has been used 50% by the OS itself.

But now I will start to build up HardQuery 5.3.3 on it, and capture the dialogs on this beautiful OS. Wish I would access the Internet this weekend.
