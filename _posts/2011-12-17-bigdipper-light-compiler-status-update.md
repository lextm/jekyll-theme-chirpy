A long time ago I announced that we will use ANTLR or other compiler framework to build a new MIB compiler. However, that approach did not work out as soon as I expected. It takes time to learn ANTLR and the tricks to play with them.

Here I simply announce two important pieces of news,

* I finally get familiar with ANTLR ABCs and will be fully focusing on it in the coming weeks. Therefore, we are closer to a new compiler than any time before.
* The old compiler just received its final revisions of improvements in the past few weeks, http://code.google.com/p/sharpsnmplib/source/detail?r=e9a1b946aac7c8ccba5321d6c87cd6a964551ef6

As a result, I will soon release #SNMP 7.5 and then start hacking on ANTLR again.

Stay tuned.
