My Dell notebook is finally arriving. And I will subscribe to local ADSL service next week. As a result, soon Code Beautifier Collection 5.3.3 will be available in weeks.

Also, there is a new version of Writer (which I am using now). It seems perfect except that it is localized. In fact, I love using an English version. I will soon delete the zh-chs folder (then it should become an English version).

The project I run in SA is now feature-frozen, which means it will be released in months. I am very happy to say that I love this job.

Now, stay tuned. Many wonderful things may happen soon.
