Well, after so many months I finally figured out how to create new Wiki pages on CodePlex.com. Therefore, now the homepage is no more crowded. The most important thing is that a unified FAQ page. Please feel free to comment on the organization so that I can adjust it later.

Happy new year, guys.

By the way, do you notice that now you can access the homepage using http://sharpsnmplib.codeplex.com ? Nice change.
