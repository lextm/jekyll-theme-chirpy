The access at home has just been setup. Some domains have been blocked by the Service Provider. Unluckily, Blogspot.com is blocked. What is interesting is that I can in contrast write posts through Blogger.com interface. Because Windows Live Writer cannot access the blocked domain, it fails, too. I will report this to the SP. Wish they could make thing right some day.

(Updated: When I got back to office, I cannot view my blog, too. The only lucky thing is that Writer at office can still work. That's alright.

In fact, Blogspot.com has been blocked many times in the past. I guess this time some people crossed the line again.)
