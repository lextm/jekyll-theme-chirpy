Well, it is pretty busy spring time. After joining Microsoft, I find that I have less and less time to work on this small project. What about the other members? If they do have blogs for me to subscribe I may have a chance to know their status.

The biggest question at this moment is, “is NOW a good time to release CrossRoad?” When CodePlex asked me what else I need for the guys, I mentioned that I think a rating system in the Source Code section will help me a lot. This idea comes from ReSharper practice, and the JetBrains guys use this way to determine if a daily build is stable enough.

When I look back at our Roadmap for 2.0, I think most are done. So it is very close to the release day. Stay tuned.
