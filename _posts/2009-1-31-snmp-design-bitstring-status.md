Well, I have to say something here about BitString class and its future.

This class was directly ported from Malcolm's code. Because I never use BIT STRING type before, I really have no idea how to use or improve this type. Therefore, when cool started this thread I initiated a research. My research ended yesterday when I came across this link. So I should stop working on this obsolete type, shouldn't I?

As a result, now this class is marked as obsolete. I won't fix any bugs myself, but if you find any bug and have a patch at hand, please feel free to contact me.
