I have to say running an open source project is not easy. I knew this when I read about open source for the first few months. I never thought I could make money from Code Beautifier Collection. Unexpectedly, this project seemed to provide me some advantages when I applied a job.

However, I am still not rich, and cannot afford a faster Internet access. I cannot finish downloading CodeGear RAD Studio 2007 today. This means I will try to make it tomorrow so my dear users can see 6.0 M5 comes on Monday morning. Wish it were not too late.

How I wish I got faster access some day so I can do things on time. Stay tuned.
