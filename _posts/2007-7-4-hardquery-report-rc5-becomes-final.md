I was about to make a Final version but finally have no time to do it at this moment. While I am moving forward to RAD Studio support, I do not want to be trapped by BDS4. As a result, I will not update HardQuery anymore and start to cook GrapeVine instead. Wish soon GrapeVine will be out.

Sorry for those who are waiting for a 5.3.3 Final. IMHO, RC5 is solid enough to be a feasible version. Maybe I should rename the package to 5.3.3.1005.zip, then InDate can find it for you.

And if everything goes well, this is the last post under "HardQuery Report". Thanks for using HardQuery builds.
