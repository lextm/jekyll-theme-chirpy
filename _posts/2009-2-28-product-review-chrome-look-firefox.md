Well, it is sad that Google Chrome does not yet support Windows 7 Beta. So I fall back to Firefox and install Total ReChrome add-on to achieve a Chrome look.

The steps are simple,

1. Install Chromifox Basic skin from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8782
1. Install Total ReChrome from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9322
1. Install Personal Menu from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3895

Note that Personal Menu is required to hide Firefox menu bar. This experimental addon only support Windows XP and Vista (as well as Win7 build 7000 is what I am using).

The final look is like this.

(Update: This trick does not yet work for FF 3.1 Beta 3. So I fall back to Chrome, but this time I use the dev channel so it works fine on Win7.)
