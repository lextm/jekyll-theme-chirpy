Today, I changed the project name to Sharp SNMP Suite. Because I am going to complete a MIB browser in 1.0 release, this project is no longer a library only. So from now on, #SNMP Suite = #SNMP Library + #SNMP MIB Browser.

Please notice the two have different licenses. The library is released under LGPL while the browser is under BSD. Using BSD for the browser is because it is also used as a demo for the library (in this case I think a less strict license is better).

Because of ISP issues, I can no longer use my SVN setup for CodePlex. Luckily, I am not stuck because Teamprise Explorer still works. Therefore, after several test check ins, now I can continue my work on #SNMP and Alex. Thank Goodness.
