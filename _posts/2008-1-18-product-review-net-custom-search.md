I am now listening to an old Podcast session of Hanselminutes which is talking about Software Architecture. In that SearchDotNet.com was introduced as a customized Google Search for .NET only. So I soon made a search on it and found that “SNMP” is such a horrible keyword that nothing really valuable was listed there.

It is not a fault of SearchDotNet.com but Google.com. Because I have been talking about .NET and SNMP in a series of posts, why not put my links on top of the list?

BTW, if you do not know Podcast, learn to use iTunes.
