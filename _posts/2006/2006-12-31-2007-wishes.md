(CSDN Dec 31, 2006)

A lot of things are done in 2006. Just in this week I released HardQuery Release 2 Update 1, the last stable version of CBC in this year and after that I moved Alex to CodePlex.

What will happen in the year of 2007? I cannot imagine. But I keep a long list here and see which would be fulfilled.

A job to start my career.
Release of GrapeVine.
Alex 2.0.
Two novels on lulu.com.
What are your dreams, my dear friends? Wish some of them would come true in 2007.

See you soon in the new year.
