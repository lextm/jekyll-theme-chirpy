It is not hard to see the InDate feature in N3 Update 1 RC 3 has some problems.
<!--more-->

When you use Options | Updateâ€¦ to get update, BDS IDE freezes/locks. Since it takes long to do a update checking and download, this locking state is very unpleasant.

Today, for the very first time I study .NET threading, and partially solve this big problem and left a small one.

Now InDate on my computer does not lock BDS IDE while it is checking the blog or downloading.

The problem remaining is that when working, InDate dialog locks. I have to find some way to solve it. It requires further study on threading and WinForms components.
