(CSDN Sept 29, 2006)

I am now working on porting more ArtCSB and SharpBuilderTools functions into CBC. As a result, many functions inside LeXDK are modified. As a result, I cannot provide Hotfixes which are much easier to install.

Why not release an Update RC again like what I had done before? Yes, in Oct. there will be such a version. I promise you. So stay tuned.
