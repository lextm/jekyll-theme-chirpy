NixNewNer versions are not mature. So they will come in May.

However, some changes are made in WalkPace.

Now the version number is 5.0.1.1018.

See the manual History section for what's new.

I am hurry on the manual now. So this afternoon the installer will be there.

This update only applied to BDS 1–2, and 4.

Currently I find that it contains something wrong with BDS 3.

For BDS 1–2 users, please delete Lextm.AddMany.Plus.plus file in bin/release manually.
