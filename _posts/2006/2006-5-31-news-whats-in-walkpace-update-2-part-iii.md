(CSDN May 31, 2006)

Since lately I will do an experiment with my mentor, I have to leave this project for a long period. Wish I could be back soon.

So I make this RC public today as soon as possible.

I don't have time to test most features added. So if you meet any problems, please list it in the bug tracker of CBC homepage on GForge.

There is no much more new things in this RC version. Much work is done on tuning the performance of AutoCompletion and Input Helper. Wish you enjoy them.

Whenever the Update 2 is finally done I will keep you all updated.
