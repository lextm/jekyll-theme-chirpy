(CSDN June 09, 2006)

It is ready this morning.

This version is very complex to implemented than last but still easy to understand, because it is in XML syntax.
<!--more-->

Plus.cs, Feature.cs, PlusArrayList.cs and FeatureList.cs are modified ((version) 2 suffix added) and a new unit EnabledRecord.cs is added.

After some tests, it will be added to N3 Update 1 RC source pack.

It will be a useful feature in that Update.

Stay tuned.
