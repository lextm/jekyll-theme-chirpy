When I made that plug-in for SharpDevelop, I was going to please myself only because I maintained CBC code in SD. However, when I released a Beta version on the SD forum, everything happened out of my expectation.

Today, there is a number of nearly 2,000 downloads on GForge home for this SharpDevelop addin. I have to say I am surprised to see it. I never dream of this before. Also, I take this sign so I will soon deliver a complete version to please the users of the Betas.

I have a few problems now but I will surely find some workarounds. Wish I could make things right.

Stay tuned.
