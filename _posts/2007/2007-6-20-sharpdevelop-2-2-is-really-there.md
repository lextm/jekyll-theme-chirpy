I prefer SharpDevelop to Visual Studio 2005 just because SD starts much faster, and everything I need to design a form or type some code is already there.

And at this moment, SharpDevelop 2.2 (only available on the build server) is much better for my use, as it can now parse complex WinForms.

However, the company is going to buy ReSharper somehow. I believe when ReSharper is available I will use Visual Studio more.
