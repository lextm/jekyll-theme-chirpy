Have to say I never thought a delay could cost so much. I cancelled my room reservation and flight tickets at weekends, which totally costs more than 200 USD. Yes, luckily my manager said the company would pay it.

Therefore, I might be there in December if I could book a room there (it is really hard to find suitable rooms) or even later.

What about my Harry Potter 7 book? I have read it three times which allows me to enjoy every hint and trick. I ought to confess this book is well written and translated. Nice work.

I know my blog is read by Brazilian guys. Why is it so hard to visit Sao Paulo in December? Is it because of Christmas? I want to know.
