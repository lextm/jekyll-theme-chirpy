I have found another issue #4 when I played with [File Browser expert](http://projectvalley.com/weblog/2007/10/delphi-2007-file-browser-expert.html). Robin has created a very nice expert while he at first released a bare .dll file. Yes, as an OTA developer I understand how to install it in a glance. But for most Delphi users, installing this expert may not be easy.

In fact, I guess using Expert Manager in Code Beautifier Collection can solve this problem. But soon I found I was wrong. Although EM can enable and disable already installed experts such as GExperts and CnWizards, it failed to add a Win32 expert like File Browser expert. Yes, that is just issue 4. And definitely this issue is very easy to fix. Sorry I never detected this item earlier.

After receiving my comments, Robin adds an installer on his blog. And after a few minutes, I fix issue 4. So now you can see both experts improved a little bit.

Stay tuned. I will release M8 this weekend.

BTW, CodeGear keeps hiring new guys now. Yes, [this opening](https://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/join-the-codegear-rad-studio-randampd-team-33778) is suitable for .NET developers who is able to work in beautiful Scott Valley.
