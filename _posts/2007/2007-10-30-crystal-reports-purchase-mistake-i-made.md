When I suggested my boss to buy me a copy of Crystal Reports, I thought that Professional SKU is fine. I was wrong. If you are using Visual Studio 2005, you should buy Crystal Reports XI Developer SKU, and then download the free XI Release 2. After installing XI R2, you can see the CR bundle in VS 2005 upgraded.

I cannot blame Business Objects for hiding this information deep on its web site. But I can now recommend you take care when buying something as expensive as this one. Make wise use of your money.

BTW, Crystal Reports 2008 will be out in November. Funny that BO drops its Roman numerals finally.
