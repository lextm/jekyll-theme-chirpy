(CSDN Feb 07, 2007)

I have been using this blog long. In the latest months I have been struggling a lot. Because I could not stand up the poor quality CSDN Blog Service, I was searching for alternatives.
<!--more-->

There are several factors a new service has to met:

1. CERNET access. I should be able to write entries without a proxy server and my classmates can access it.
1. Firefox compatibility. Live Spaces fails to meet this.
1. Easy to use.

After all, I find Blogger today. Soon I will stop posting here and build up a new blog there. Thanks for those who read and comment here. You may see my new blog here: https://docs.lextudio.com/blog.

P.S., I have to mention that in fact, CSDN provides more features than Blogger. However, I am caring about stability more.

也懒得逐字翻译。上面的意思就是说CSDN的blog服务我受够了，马上就转到谷歌Blogger上面去了。请关注这个博客的朋友们注意更改你们的RSS设置。
