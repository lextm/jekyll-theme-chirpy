I know SVN may take place of CVS some day, but now I guess it still works well. So this time I use CVSNT as my source control server. If you do not know how to get started, there is [a short introduction](http://www.codeproject.com/macro/CVS_with_VSNET.asp) on The Code Project.

I never know the plug-in mentioned in this article but it works fine. Wish you enjoy the ease of using a source control system as I do.

BTW, after all, commercial solutions such as StarTeam from Borland will reduce you much effort. If you can afford, give them a try.

(Updated: StudioTools 2 + TortoiseCVS is my solution at this moment which work out to be free and convenient.)

(Updated: Please consider distributed version control system, such as Mercurial/Git. Mercurial is more Windows friendly IMHO.)
