My boss will send me to Brazil for a business trip. I am about to arrive in Sao Paolo on October 30th, and stay there for 4 days. I am looking forward to the trip except I need an injection of yellow fever bacterin this Friday (a little bit afraid).

The bad thing is that I pre-ordered a Chinese edition of Harry Potter 7 which starts to ship on October 28th. There fore the book may not be able to reach me before my leaving. If I can enjoy the book while I am flying to Brazil, the time difference might not be a problem.
