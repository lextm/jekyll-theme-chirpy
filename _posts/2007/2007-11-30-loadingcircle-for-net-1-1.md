Do you know that you can easily add a Firefox or IE 7 look LoadingCircle in your .NET applications? Please take a look at [this old CodeProject article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14841/How-to-write-a-loading-circle-animation-in-NET).

I read this article when I was still working on CBC 5.* which is on .NET 1.1. Therefore I tried to port it back to .NET 1.1 and I was successful. Though there should be very limited code modifications, in case you do not want to do it yourself, please download the binary I used in HardQuery here.

I should post about this earlier because now .NET 3.5 is out there and less people use .NET 1.1.

BTW, the code should be in public domain. Correct me if I were wrong.
