Do you know Safari? Apple's web browser for Mac OS. And now, it can be installed on Windows.

http://www.apple.com/safari/download/

Nice UI, and similar shortcuts as Firefox (like Firefox in iTunes theme). Firefox now has more competitors on Windows (IE, Safari, Maxthon, Opera and so on).

For me, Firefox is a better one. And I surely will give Safari a try.

(Updated: If you are a Chinese like me, you will find it impossible to input Chinese with Google Pinyin. I do not try other input method because I love Google Pinyin. I have reported this to Apple. Wish they can find a solution soon. In this aspect, Firefox 3 Alpha (Gran Paradiso) plays much better.)
