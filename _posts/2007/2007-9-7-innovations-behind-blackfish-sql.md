If you are now reading this post like me, scroll to the third paragraph, and you can see why it is version 8 here.

Yes, it is wonderful that a Java to C# translator does exist and produce this wonderful product on both platforms. (If you move on you can see Java can be translated to Object Pascal too.)

It is easy to understand why CodeGear drops the NDataStore name and also renames JDataStore to Blackfish SQL for Java. When you have a product on both sides, neither "J" nor "N" is necessary.

If you are looking for tiny database, Blackfish SQL is a choice (1.2M engine).

BTW, Blackfish will be included in CodeGear RAD Studio 2007 DVD.
