It is the first blog entry here. Since I have been blogging a lot in the Beta version of blog.CSDN.net, I think it is nice to have some other stabler server. Yes, Live Spaces from MS is a choice, but I cannot comment on my friend's blog in Firefox, the greatest browser I ever see. So I am now giving blogger a chance. We will see if it works finer.

That is all for the first entry. And now I am going to see what I can do here in Blogger.

In order to save efforts, I will leave my old posts there in CSDN. If you'd like to see them, go to https://blog.csdn.net/lextm
