It is occasional that I created InDate, auto update component of CBC. And the logic used in InDate is simple,

1. download a package list from a fixed URL.
1. analyze the list and find latest update.
1. download the update and run the installer.

Is it similar to other update components in other products? I guess yes. Even some spyware follow these steps in order to install more spyware on your computer.

So if you find some anti-spyware on your computer treat InDate as a spyware, please be careful before removing it.

Luckily, even if you have removed InDate, you can still find latest update on Google Code Homepage.
