CodeGear released RAD Studio 2007 a few days ago. And Delphi 2007 Update 3 was then available, too. They both require a new version of Code Beautifier Collection, which now I happily announce is available at Google Code Homepage.

According to old posts, there are only changes in the installer while other changes are scheduled to M6.

Notice that you need to install latest Update 3 of Delphi 2007 or C++Builder 2007. CBC installer will warn you if necessary.

Stay tuned.
