I have been watching the Banshee Media Player for months, but it does not yet support Windows even though in the announcement it will hit Windows soon.

In order to see how soon it would be, today I searched its forum, and came across this post. So, the Windows version is on its way. Nice.

If you can understand the details posted in the thread, there are still several issues out there. Hope the guys can solve them all in the next few months. I just cannot wait. :-)
