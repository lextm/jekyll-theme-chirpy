Visual Studio does provide some basic IIS Express integration, such as opening sites from IIS Express, and exposes a limited set of settings for you to configure,

* Anonymous Authentication
* SSL Enabled
* SSL URL
* URL (not modifiable)
* Windows Authentication

That's never enough if we are used to full IIS, and IIS Manager.

Does Jexus Manager for IIS Express offer something better? Yes, the following are coming in 2.0 Alpha 5,

* Changes to authentication settings are persist to disk (read-only in the past).
* Changes to sites/applications (add/removal) are persisted to disk (read-only in the past).
* Changes to site bindings are persisted to disk (read-only in the past).
* Experimental server certificate support (requires to be run as administrator).
With such new additions, it is OK now to manage quite a few important features of IIS Express.

Jexus Manager for IIS Express Alpha 5 is available at https://jexus.codeplex.com/releases/view/138373

Stay tuned.
