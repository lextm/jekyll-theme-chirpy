I have just installed the trial version of C++Builder 2007 and built CBC HardQuery against .NET 2.0 and ToolsAPI 5.0. And then I manually added the needed registry item. Launch C++Builder 2007 and CBC is there!

I used Window Clippings 2.0 to catch the picture and a bug of it can be seen in the first picture that Window Clippings dialog is not hidden at all.

I will soon deliver you 5.3.3 Final. After that, I would spend more time on .NET 2.0 and ToolsAPI 5.0. In case you forget, 5.3.3 will be the last version of CBC on .NET 1.1 and the .NET 2.0 version is code named GrapeVine.

Stay tuned.

(Updated: The splash window picture has been updated. Window Clippings' dialog is removed.)
