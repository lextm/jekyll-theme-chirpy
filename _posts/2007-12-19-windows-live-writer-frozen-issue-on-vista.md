The Windows Update brings me the latest WLW last weekend. But from then on I have experiences several WLW frozen issues on Windows Vista Home Basic. The problem is that after clicking the Publish button, the dialogue freezes and I cannot operate it any more.

The terrible thing is that I cannot even kill the process to get rid of the frozen WLW (it is closed if I log out or shut down Windows). This issue is rather annoyed but I do not know if anyone meets the same issue. I have Vista SP1 RC installed. Wish this RC is not the cause (if it is I have to uninstall it soon).

BTW, WLW latest version runs well on Windows XP SP2.
