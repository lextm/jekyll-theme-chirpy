I know you’ve been waiting because HardQuery R2 or 5.3 is not flawless. We see there are bugs inside and I fix some of them in this version, 5.3.1. Also during my job hunting days I make a few new units to simplify the development of CBC and LeXDK. I have to say the sad days teaches me a lot of lessons, and I really learn a lot.

Wish I could finish the tests soon in this week. I may not be able to finish them before X’mas, but it will be ready before 2007.

Stay tuned my friends.
