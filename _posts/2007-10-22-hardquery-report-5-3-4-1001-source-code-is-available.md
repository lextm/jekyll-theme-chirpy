This time the source code is available earlier than binary. Why? Because I can no longer compile it on this Dell Inspiron 640m, I have to release the source at first.

If you set up an environment according to this post, you should be able to compile and build 5.3.4.1001 on your machine.

This version contains back-ported bug fixes from latest GrapeVine 6.0.0.1008 for CodeGear RAD Studio 2007.

You can see what issues are resolved at CBC Homepage.

You can download the source code here.
