This is a new homepage for Code Beautifier Collection I registered on Google Code. At this moment, GrapeVine Milestone 2 is already there. Yep, you can download it fresh there.

But please notice InDate feature is not yet complete, so I cannot guarantee it works correctly. Believe me, I would make it complete at least in M3.

What is new in this version,

1. Expert Manager works again but needs elevation on Windows Vista.
1. Vista UI controls are used everywhere necessary.

Stay tuned.
