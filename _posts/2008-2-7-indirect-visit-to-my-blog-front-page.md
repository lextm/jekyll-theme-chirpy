Because of the Great Wall I cannot visit my blog at home (fortunately from this month on I can do it at office as IP address there is acquired from a San Jose server. It seems that in that way the Great Wall fails). However, last month I found out a way to indirectly visit the front page somehow. Since I suddenly forgot the link I did not post that earlier.

Today luckily I reproduced the page, and here is the tip.

1. Click the Layout link on Blogger Dashboard.
1. Click the Preview button.

Then your web browser will lead you to a place whose URL starts with http://www.blogger.com. But it is still your blog front page, isnâ€™t it?

In this way I finally can take a look at it at home to see if my customizations lately look fine.
