I have finished most of SNMP v1 support today. If you check out #SNMP source code, three new demos can show you how to do GET NEXT operation, how to walk, and how to access a table.

From now on, I am going to focus on MIB file support. As I listed there in the task list, only basic MIB file support will be provided in next series of #SNMP, the 0.9 series.

Stay tuned.
