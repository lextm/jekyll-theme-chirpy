I have just installed Visual Studio 2008 Express at home last Wednesday, and this morning I received a notification from InstallAware that its update for .NET 3.5 is ready. It is so fast that I suddenly remember that Microsoft launches .NET 3.5 RTM with Visual Studio 2008 RTM last week.

I do not know about other vendors’ update but I am sure InstallAware is fast enough. So now I can build installers for .NET 3.5 easily with IA. The only problem is that .NET 3.5 runtime is so big (with .NET 2.0 SP1 and .NET 3.0 SP1) that even deployment on Windows Vista is terrible. In the past, a lot of developers give up .NET because of its huge framework. And now I guess no one will be interested in developing client applications with .NET. Yes, .NET 3.5 runtime is about 100M.

The only lucky thing is that Windows Server 2008 will surely bundle .NET 3.5. Because Windows XP’s end is drawing near and Windows Vista is not yet popular, Microsoft can wish everyone moves to Windows Server 2008 and .NET 3.5 in 2008.
