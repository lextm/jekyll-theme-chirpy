Today, Idan Computer's CEO reported a GrapeVine issue to me. Amazing, I never thought this small utility could run on a CEO's machine. Also, this CEO does programming (!!!) which reminds me of Castalia's author Jacob.

You can read about the report and [my workaround here](http://code.google.com/p/lextudio/issues/detail?id=5). Wish I could resolve it this weekend. Stay tuned.
