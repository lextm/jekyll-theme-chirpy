Lately I have been fighting against the heat around me at home because it is so hot here at Shanghai this summer. Therefore, I did not add new stuffs to the browser. However, did you notice the updates in SNMP v2 support inside the library such as exceptions and TRAP v2 support? Sometimes I feel it much easier to add things in a library than an application.

After so many changes underlying, I think now it is time to prepare the 1.0 release of #SNMP. In the current plan, this release still focuses on the library itself (the browser and other samples are only available in source code form). And Iâ€™d like to release the first full feature MIB browser in a new release called TwinTower (1.5).

Stay tuned.
