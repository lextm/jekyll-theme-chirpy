I am quite happy that CodePlex creates a snapshot of my every check in. This is really going to hurt some users because I may carelessly or be forced to commit a broken version. In this case I really love CVS or SVN because I can tag out working versions.

And a critical issue I met tonight is that the snapshot was broken while my repository was correct. So how can I fix it?Crazy bug!!!

So my dear friends, let's forget about those snapshots listed here. You can always use a client to download all source code easily.

BTW, I am giving up Teamprise Explorer from now on. Though it has better integration with TFS, I prefer an SVN style environment.
