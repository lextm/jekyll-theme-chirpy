I have been wondering why after installing Visual Studio 2005 I could not find Team Explorer anywhere. Until today when I tried to find a client tool for CodePlex, I saw a notice Team Explorer is a separate installer from Visual Studio which you have to download directly from Microsoft.

As a result, I have to install Team Explorer and Visual Studio 2005 SP1 again, which takes a very very long time.

Why not add Team Explorer into Visual Studio 2005 installer as a feature?
