It is tonight that I finally publish all source code of April 08 Release.You can check it out following this guide.

http://code.google.com/p/lextudio/source/checkout

From now on, I am going to use the SVN repository provided by Google Code. You can always keep an eye there.

There may be some other issues I am not aware now ('cause I am not an SVN expert) but I will fix them all in a few days. Stay tuned.

(Update: If you failed to build the source on your machine, please [read this post]({% post_url 2007/2007-10-8-grapevine-voice-how-to-build-it-on-your-machine-part-ii %}) carefully.)
