Well, although this RC3 bit missed its original target day seriously (according to [this post]({% post_url 2008/2008-10-1-snmp-design-the-first-performance-analysis %}) and [this one]({% post_url 2008/2008-10-12-snmp-design-changes-from-steve-and-latest-news %}), it did bring a lot more.

Stay tuned.
