The first poll about #SNMP future was closed a few days earlier. The result shows there are guys who are interested in agent development on .NET. Quite surprising because I thought only C, C++, and Java are popular.

So I will put this requirement on the list but with a low priority (but higher than SNMP v3 at this moment). It is really challenging as this may require a powerful MIB compiler implementation ahead.

OK. That's all for this time. Stay tuned.
