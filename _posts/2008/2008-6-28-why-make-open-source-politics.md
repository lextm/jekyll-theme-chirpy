As an open source developer, I just want to do some work I like and don't want to bind so many unrelated stuff to something I love. However, yesterday afternoon it was said that SF.net was blocked in China Mainland. I didn't buy it until last night I found I was wrong. Why?

I just could not believe this was caused by Notepad++, but it was months ago when I saw the banner setup there saying stuff about the Beijing Olympic that I started to worry about the author of N++, although this tool has become a must.

Why he made open source part of politics? Sad.
