This morning I received a mail from Anthony, JCF's author. Because he is so busy, a final reply is going to reach me maybe next week. And if you know Chinese culture, next Wednesday is Chinese New Year Eve. How I wish I could publish 6.o Final by then but nothing is settled down.

Stay tuned. I will keep you update.
