There are two significant bugs inside UnicornHorn release that are fixed lately. Thus, I plan to release an refresh release this weekend. The version number should be 1.1.

Major changes are,

* Work Item 2763 closed
* TRAP-TYPE bug fixed
* Manager.GetTable validation weakened.

Even though the MIB browser has been updated lately, it is still an Alpha baby.

Stay tuned.
