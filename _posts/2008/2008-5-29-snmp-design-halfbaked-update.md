I was out of luck. Last weekend I joined an offsite meeting and had my left elbow badly hurt. And last night I got a fever.

My bad luck had big impact on #SNMP. Even though I had already frozen the source code for the 0.5 (Halfbaked) release last week, I didn't have time and energy to publish it. Sorry for the delay.

I've just noticed there are so many downloads during this month. So thank you for trying out this library, guys. If nothing worse happens, I am going to publish this very first release of #SNMP tomorrow night.

Stay tuned.
