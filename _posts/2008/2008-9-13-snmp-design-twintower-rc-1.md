So it is already there for hours. Although it is marked as 1.4, it is still really a RC for TwinTower, our upcoming 1.5 release. The source code behind is Change Set 15687.

Due to Steve's move and my departure from Cisco, both of us have not enough time to ship a final release soon. Therefore, now we are on [this "RC First" schedule]({% post_url 2008-9-9-snmp-design-update-on-twintower-release-candidate %}). OK.

Stay tuned. Once the second RC is ready, I am going to publish with Steve.
