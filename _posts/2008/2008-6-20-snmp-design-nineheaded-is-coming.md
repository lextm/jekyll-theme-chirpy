I am going to release NineHeaded (0.9) release of #SNMP this weekend. And right now the only requirement before 1.0 is a lot of samples.

In the past couple of weeks I have helped one developer who is interested in #SNMP and found out that if #SNMP provides more samples and documentation he should have worked things out himself long before. Sorry Peter, I am going to improve in these fields ASAP.
