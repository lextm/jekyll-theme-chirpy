Did you read [this post]({% post_url 2008/2008-2-18-office-2007-style %}) You might think I use Krypton Toolkit, but in fact I didn't because Krypton Toolkit is not open source.

This article is quite important in this case. It seems Phil did not place an EULA there to restrict us, so I think why not make use of the wonderful code?

That's it! The screen shot above is the latest Expert Manager UI. Do you like it?

An issue that always bothers me is that I cannot find icons that I can use freely. Luckily I met Tango this week and WOW there are a lot of beautiful icons. That's why for the first time you see icons on the tool strip above.

I wish the 6.0 Update 1 bring you a better experience later this year.
