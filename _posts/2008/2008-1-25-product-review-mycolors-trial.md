Stardock Object Desktop is a collection of applications that beautifies your Windows experience. But not every bit of OD is a must. For example, a free set consisting of ObjectDock, CursorFX makes me happy enough.

Last week I decided to have a test on MyColors, a smaller feature set of OD which consists of basic functions from WindowBlinds, IconPackage, and DesktopX.

I have to say the effort is quite satisfactory, but it eats up nearly all the available memory (Update: this is simply because I am using Windows Vista Home Basic with 1G memory and normally Windows consumes over 800M of it). Therefore, finally I have to give up because I must do other things on my machine.

The only problem is that the designers of MyColors do not have chance to test on Simplified Chinese Windows so the fonts look not perfectly. Wish they could solve such kind of issues in the future.
