The development of #SNMP 8 wonâ€™t be an easy task, as so many things related to the compiler must be reviewed and enhanced. So in order to provide users a quick update, a new release candidate of 7.5 release is now uploaded.

This release is mainly a bug fix release but also contains a limited set of breaking changes (work item 7224, 7225, 7226). There is also a NuGet prerelease package available (based on the same change set).

Stay tuned.
