I have just checked Code Beautifier Collection homepage on Google Code and found out an interesting thing. In a short time period, it seems that people prefer the installer, so for most GrapeVine milestone builds the installer download count is larger than the source code count. It is reasonable because during milestones, the code has changed a lot. However, for a long term (about 4 months), the source code download count is nearly 3 times of the installer count (for 6.0 Final).

There must be a reason, but I havenâ€™t got it yet.
