I recently switched to openSUSE 12.1 fully as my desktop failed to serve Windows 7 without hang or crash. One difficulty right now is that I could not install Citrix Receiver as wished by downloading their 64 bit .rpm package [1].

I did not want to give up easily, so I downloaded the .tar.gz package and attempted to install. It also failed, as it refused to work for 64 bit CPU architecture.

I was so used to WOW64 on Windows, and I ignored the fact that now Linux also supports something similar till today I launched the 32 bit Terminal for the first time.

Well, that’s it. the .tar.gz installer worked fine in 32 bit Terminal (with sudo of course). Then I could see Citrix Receiver icon in Gnome 3.

``` bash
sudo ./setupwfc
```

The last issue was that SSL error 61 occurred. It was easily solved by copying Firefox certificates [2].

``` bash
sudo cp /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/* /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts
```
