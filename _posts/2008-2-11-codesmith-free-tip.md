It is said that CodeSmith is a must for .NET developers. However, even though I have been doing C# for years, I do not use it that frequently. So I prefer the free 2.6 version.

But time goes by so quickly that you may find it fails to launch on Windows Vista. Why it complains that while Vista pre-installs .NET 2.0 and 3.0? I guess .NET beginners would find it miserable.

Adding a .NET 2.0 line is enough.
