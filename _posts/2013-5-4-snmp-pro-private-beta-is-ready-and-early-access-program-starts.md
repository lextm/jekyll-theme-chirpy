> Updated: [The EAP has already ended](/snmp-pro-early-access-program-ends-92f9fb358fc3).

After the original announcement on April 6th, I have been working hard on finishing the 1.0 feature set of #SNMP MIB Compiler Pro. Now I believe the time is right and let’s kick off the Early Access Program (EAP).
<!--more-->

You are welcome to write to support@lextudio.com using the following email template,

> Hi Lex,

> * Nationality: `*****`
> * Email Address: `***@***`
> * Phone Number: `***-****-****`

Then please wait till you receive the invitation.

Once you are added to the private beta mailing list and receive the private beta files, please follow the these steps to request a license file.

# Generate License Hint

1. Launch the compiler by double clicking Compiler.exe.
1. Go to Help | Register Product menu item.
1. In Register dialog, fill in the User name field and click Generate Hint button. The hint data will be generated in the Hint field.
1. Click Copy Hint button to copy the data to clipboard.
1. Paste that data to an email and send to me.
1. Exit the Register dialog by clicking the red cross on top right corner.

# License Activation
I will send the license key back via email. Then you just need to perform the following steps to get the compiler activated,

1. Launch the compiler by double clicking Compiler.exe.
1. Go to Help | Register Product menu item.
1. In Register dialog, switch to Product Key Registration tab.
1. Paste the license key to the text box and click Register.
1. Exit the Register dialog by clicking the red cross on top right corner.

The goal of this EAP is to test out the licensing system, and also show you what has been implemented so far in the Pro edition.

A reviewer’s guide (user manual) is in progress (will be ready in the coming weeks) which summarizes details on some of the important features.
