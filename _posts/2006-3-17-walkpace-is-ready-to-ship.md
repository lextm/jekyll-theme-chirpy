Since Iâ€™ve finally done the .plus file format specifications and implementation, I can now say that all required feature for CBC WalkPace is done and it is ready to ship next week.

It is very funny that I have put BeWise code inside and outside many times and at last put them all (but one) outside. Maybe now it is easy for you to build a BDS 2006 usable SBT. The tip should be updated soon.

Main features of WalkPace has been mentioned before. And the details will be in the updated manuals and articles.

Keep patience.
