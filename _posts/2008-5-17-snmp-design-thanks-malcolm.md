If you follow my post, you know that #SNMP is based on Malcolm Crowe's SNMP tools in C#. On May 13th, I reported to him my research on #SNMP, and he was so kind that he listed #SNMP besides his own library on his page. Malcolm, thank you so much.

Now I am working on the MIB file support. Stay tuned.
