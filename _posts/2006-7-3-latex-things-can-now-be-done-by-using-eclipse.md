It is common to develop Java projects by using Eclipse.

I still wonder how to use it to develop C++ projects on Windows.

However, today I am using it to make documents powered by LaTeX.

It is not hard to make this possible. Install Eclipse and add a plugin named TeXlipse.

It is quite useful than EditPlus.

Code Folding is my favourite feature. And the real time error displaying.

Wonderful.

If you are new to Eclipse, youâ€™d better use EasyEclipse packages to install both Eclipse and TeXlipse.

The packages I choose are EasyEclipse for Python and TeXlipse.
