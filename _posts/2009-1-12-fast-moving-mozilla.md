Well, I know I should not talk too much about Firefox 3.1 or Thunderbird simply because they are still Beta. However, I just couldn't help letting you know how much I love the improvements.

Firefox 3.1b2
It is so cool that Firefox adds something Chrome has. I can easily drag a tab to its own window to I don't have to switch between two of them. I believe it is a must-have feature if you have two or more monitors. How I wish other browsers support this useful feature!

Thunderbird 3.0b1
The redesigned user interface is very neat, although the idea always to put a close button on the default tab is surely not something good. Wish they could fix this in the final.

Have to confess that this time they are both very stable. Awesome!
