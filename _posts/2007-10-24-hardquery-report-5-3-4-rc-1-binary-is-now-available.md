I have just compiled 5.3.4 source code to binary and the process is not pleasant. The source code package in fact can only compiled without an error on .NET 2.0. I had to modify a few lines in order to compile it successfully under .NET 1.1. So if you find that you cannot compile the source code on your PC, try to download the binary version instead.

And I need to confess that this RC 1 binary is not tested anywhere because I do not have a test environment right now to test it with C#Builder 1.0 to Delphi 2006. I can only wish my bug fixes ported back do not introduce new bugs in HardQuery.

If you would like to test this RC 1 on your PC, please drop me a note whether it runs OK. Thanks.

I will keep you updated if there is another RC version. Stay tuned.
