Borland.Studio.ToolsAPI.dll is an important reference assembly used by Code Beautifier Collection and other experts. Version 1â€“4 of it was built against .NET 1.1. And now, version 5 included in Delphi 2007 and C++Builder 2007 is against .NET 2.0.

In order to consume the interfaces defined in ToolsAPI 5.0, CBC should be compiled against .NET 2, too. However, I guess the source code can still be ported back to .NET 1.1 with modifications. Now I am evaluating the possibility.

Remember, even if the back port is possible, I insist Delphi 2007 and C++Builder 2007 be used. Support to older versions of BDS is stopped once 5.3.3 is released.

BTW, an experimental build of GExperts with DelForEx has been uploaded to CodeCentral now.
