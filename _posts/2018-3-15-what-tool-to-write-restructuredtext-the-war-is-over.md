I started to develop the reStructuredText extension for Visual Studio Code in November 2015. [Sublime Text](https://github.com/mgaitan/sublime-rst-completion) and [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-restructuredtext) were more popular editors back then, and they have reStructuredText support.

Both Visual Studio Code and my extension were new in the field, and the future was not clear.

Two years has passed.

Hours ago, Stack Overflow published its Developer Survey Results for 2018, and surprisingly Visual Studio Code takes the crown,

My extension accumulated 100,000 downloads,

It is probably not the extension itself wins the war at last, but Visual Studio Code that draws the attention of so many developers and documentation authors here.

An honor to serve so many users and their daily work, and hope I can do better in the coming months.

Stay tuned.
