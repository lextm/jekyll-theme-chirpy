On Twitter, I have been discussing with @walshmichael on GPL. Well, Twitter is really a bad place to discuss such advanced topics.

I don't want to waste time any further on this topic as everyone has his/her own point of view. But if you are the one who wants to start/join a new open source project, or plan to discuss with others on open source licenses, you should spare some time first on the following books,

I never regret that my choices of the licenses for my open source projects, and with the knowledge I don't blame others for their choices either. I am coding for fun, not for money.

C'est la vie.
