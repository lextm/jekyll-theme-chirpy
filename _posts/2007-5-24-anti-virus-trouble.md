I have just bought a Dell notebook. As a result, I will soon start to use an anti-virus product. Which one I will buy?

Latest news warns me of Norton and Kaba, and I don't like Duba. So I have quite a limited range to choose from, haven't I?

In fact, after some simple evaluations, I prefer Kaba (Kaspersky). It is not too expensive (88 RMB per year), and easy to pay the bill over Internet. Other products either fail to list the fee apparently or fail to provide a online payment system.

In order to save money, I can even try Kaba with no charge for 30 days which is a good bonus before I pay.
