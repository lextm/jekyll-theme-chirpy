[Update: Microsoft starts to officially support Mono, so please simply use latest NuGet executable such as 3.5]

> In [part I](/how-to-use-nuget-on-mono-part-i-8d2cd63bd1e0) and [part II](/how-to-use-nuget-on-mono-part-ii-1e71e55757bd) I have already mentioned the steps you need to follow. [Part III](/how-to-use-nuget-on-mono-part-iii-bc1d14e79db4) is about Mono packaging. This post described how we should patch NuGet so that it works better on Mono.

I have opened [a bug of NuGet on its homepage](http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/3007) earlier today. I noticed it when I attempted to build my open source project #SNMP on Mono/Linux, as NuGet seems to ignore installed packages, which leads to multiple downloads of the same package and hurt performance significantly.

Therefore, I downloaded NuGet source code on Mono/Linux and planed to build it. Failed. Alright, this is not a NuGet issue right now, as xbuild is not strong enough to support the build, which have been reported a long time ago and multiple times. Sadly Mono guys do not yet resolve it.

Anyway, I then downloaded the source code (NuGet 2.2 release, not master) to Windows, and used Visual Studio 2012 to build it. After that, I copied the instrumented binary (with Console.WriteLine everywhere necessary) to my Linux box. Guess what? This triggers a very strange error message, which I could not find any information on the web,

If you happen to meet the same exception message after following http://docs.nuget.org/docs/contribute/setting-up-the-nuget-development-environment, please don’t panic as this is by design. The NuGet site steps will generate binaries compiled against .NET 4.5 profile, which is not yet available in Mono stable releases (2.10.*). You have to use Visual Studio 2010 to build the binaries (Core and CommandLine projects).
[Update: the exception is not Mono alone. If you run a .NET 4.5 program on .NET 4 you might hit the same, http://www.mattwrock.com/post/2012/02/29/What-you-should-know-about-running-ILMerge-on-Net-45-Beta-assemblies-targeting-Net-40.aspx]

Well, if you find that you cannot open the two projects correctly in VS2010, please go to Build\NuGet.Settings.targets file, and change

```
$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\..\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\IDE
```

to something invalid, such as

```
$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\..\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\IDE
```

Then VS2010 should be able to open the two projects correctly.

Finally the instrumented binary told me that `PhysicalFileSystem.GetDirectory` and `PhysicalFileSystem.GetFiles` do not work as expected. Why? I laughed when I opened this method,

``` csharp
private static string EnsureTrailingSlash(string path)
{
    if (!path.EndsWith(“\\”, StringComparison.Ordinal))
    {
        path += “\\”;
    }
    return path;
}
```

OK. If you are familiar with http://www.mono-project.com/Guidelines:Application_Portability, it is obvious that “\\” is the culprit. You should use Path.DirectorySeparatorChar to replace it.

Right now I am ready to fork NuGet, fix this issue, and send back a pull request.

[Update: Luckily NuGet guys already fixed it in master branch on Dec 5, 2012. Hope its 2.3 release comes soon.]

After so many struggles, I finally finish the series of this topic, and hope you also learn a lot from my experience like I did.
