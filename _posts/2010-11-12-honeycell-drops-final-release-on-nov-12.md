After five beta builds, the final release of #SNMP 6.0 became available on Nov 12.

Because this time the release notes are already embedded in the download page, you can take a look at it while your browser downloads the packages for you.

Help docs are packaged in a separate ZIP.

Please pay attention to the (Breaking) changes if you want to migrate from an old release.
