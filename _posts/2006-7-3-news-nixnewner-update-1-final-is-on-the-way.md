(CSDN July 03, 2006)

Latest Release Candidate 6 is very stable now. So I think it is time to release the Final.
<!--more-->

Since I have learned regular expression, I decide to make InDate 2 with it. (InDate 1 uses some basic string matching technique and not easy to enhance later.) However, it is not easy to test and finish InDate 2 soon.

When InDate 2 is done, the Final version will be available immediately. For those RC users, InDate 1 may be used to download this Final build.
