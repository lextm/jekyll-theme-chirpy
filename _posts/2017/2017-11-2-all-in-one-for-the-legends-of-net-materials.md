I am going to give [a talk on The Legends of .NET](https://mvpdaysv-conference2017-1.busyconf.com/activities/59ebb3464ee06baeb80001c9) on Jan 17, 2018.

Not quite sure if I can finish translating [my Chinese book .NET Legend](https://nianbiao.lextudio.com/) to English by then, but I would try to finish a few more stories in English.

You can find the [.NET Ecosystem timeline](https://corefx.lextudio.com/), which can help you understand the events, products, and people.

The current "Rough History" posts should be seen as drafts for the upcoming English book, as the complimentary materials. They are,

- [The Rough History of MSBuild]({% post_url 2017/2017-11-1-the-rough-history-of-msbuild %})
- [The Rough History of The So Many C# Compilers]({% post_url 2017/2017-10-29-the-rough-history-of-the-so-many-c-compilers %})
- [The Rough History of ASP.NET on IIS]({% post_url 2017/2017-10-22-the-rough-history-of-asp-net-on-iis %})
- [The Rough History of Referenced Assemblies]({% post_url 2018/2018-7-28-the-rough-history-of-referenced-assemblies %})
- [The Rough History of .NET Core Debuggers]({% post_url 2019/2019-8-14-the-rough-history-of-net-core-debuggers %})
- [The Rough History of .NET Framework Reference Source]({% post_url 2020/2020-12-13-the-rough-history-of-microsoft-reference-source %})

There are also some related posts I did in the past,

- [The Story About .NET Cross Platform UI Frameworks]({% post_url 2017/2017-7-3-the-story-about-net-cross-platform-ui-frameworks %})
- [Status of MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio]({% post_url 2017/2017-7-24-status-of-monodevelop-xamarin-studio %})

This post would be updated frequently to reflect future posts and the news about that English book.

Stay tuned.
