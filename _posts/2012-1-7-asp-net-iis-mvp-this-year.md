Iâ€™ve just received the MVP award from Microsoft under ASP.NET/IIS category for 2012. Though losing my 7-day-long brand new Android phone yesterday makes my life bit of tough, I still consider that it is generally brighter this year for me.

Not yet get my gift box, which FedEx says will arrive next Monday. But I wish that I could do more than last year for the whole IIS/.NET community.
