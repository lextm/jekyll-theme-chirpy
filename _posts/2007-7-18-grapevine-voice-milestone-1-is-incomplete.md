I have to confess Vista User Access Control brings me a lot of trouble. Up to now, I cannot make Expert Manager work correctly. The should-be-deleted registry items cannot be deleted yet.

As a result, Milestone 1 is still a Preview version, which cannot update to later versions and Expert Manager does not function well. However, other parts are alright.

BTW, the settings file is resident in a user-specific location so after installation, CBC can be used on by who installed it.

Download it from here.
